  I ordered Chinese food that delivered me back to my fond memories of eating Chinese food in New York. Their chicken chow mien combination which included won ton soup, crunchy noodles, fried rice, and an egg roll was déjà vu to my taste buds. The fact that New York Chinese Restaurant includes won ton soup instead of the conventional egg drop soup made an impression on me. The New York style chow mien that they feature is a different entrée than the chow Mein served in Las Vegas Chinese restaurants.  This chow mien is vegetable instead of noodle based. Because I dislike celery, I specifically directed them to eliminate the celery. They listened and the chow mien was first-rate. 

The service that night was a tiny bit slow because it was such a busy night. This did not bother us at all though, the food was too good that it distracted us. I can't wait to come back to this place again :D
Terrible, over priced for what u get which is what i believe msg filled crapy Chinese. ive given them 3 chances with 3 dif dishes for take out. the vibe i get is a retired couple barley hanging on to the place that have lost their passion for food.

Great little place for dine in or take out we have tried both, everything was fresh and seasoned well, not overly salty. Great service.
Over all the fried rice was really good as well. Other places offer free egg rolls when you order so much food. In which case I do!  This particular locations doesn't. (which is whatever you know)

- Combination Fried Rice
The rest of the dish was forgettable... Just your typical white rice and water.  I'm sure this place has some good dishes, but I clearly didn't order one of them.
I went for dinner and had Kung pao chicken takeout. The girl working the counter was very friendy. I loved her! 
-Decor was very nice.
what's cool is that they offer brown rice and i don't recall them charging extra for requesting it (take note other nickel-and-dime you to death restaurants)!
Some of the pervious reviewers disparage Chen Wok for being small with "Costco Tables."  If one wants atmosphere, then go to P. F. Chang's and pay triple for half the food.  Chen Wok is fine example of the small independent American business.  They deserve your support and patronage a hell of a lot more than the McDiarrhea's in the parking lot.  I gave them 5 stars because of value and quality and taste.  I can live without the pretentious of atmosphere.
An order of Steamed Prawn Dumplings featured four plump and juicy Steamed Shrimp Dumplings in a basket.  Classic Hot & Sour Soup was heat hot and spicy, with bamboo shoots, strands of egg white, scallions, and mushrooms. 
After a few years we eventually went, and the food is by far and way the best Chinese food we have eaten in Edinburgh. The service was great, but it comes back to the food.


Do not leave here without ordering the hot and sour soup! SO GOOD and has a decent kick AND only $1.75!
I will give them a break. They have very attentive service, and are really nice people. Stick to the dishes with fresh veggies lightly prepared. 

Still my favorite chinese food in Vegas for take out. I get the Mongolian Beef or Kung Pao Triple Delight everytime!
great take-out--inside has no atmosphere, very clean, for loners who don't want table service and don't mind eating with plastic utensils on styrofoam-ick.  Owners are friendly--and give efficient service.  Be careful with hours.  Weekday afternoon "break" from 2-4 PM often extends until 4:15--have not always waited--just gone elsewhere. Vietnamese specials also made by request only.
It's not easy to find a chinese place in Chandler.  When I decided to give iKitchen a try, I did not have my hopes up.  I have to say it wasn't bad.  I had the beef noodle soup and boba milk tea.  The milk tea was good - not overly sweet.  The bobas were chewy and not mushy.  The noodle soup was tasty, although not what I expected.  The beef stew they use is more like what is usually served with rice.  Either way, I enjoyed it.  And it was reassuring to see that the waitress and cook (whom I assume to be the owners) were both chinese.  The restaurant is a low key, taiwanese deli-like restaurant in a strip mall (like everything else in Chandler).  This is not the same chinese food as LA, but I will go back or get take out when I have a hankering for Chinese.
Two words, HOUSE CHICKEN. The gentleman at the counter is nothing but polite, and willing to bring me a side of chili paste for my fried rice. A small order of the chicken and a small order of fried rice feeds two, and I'm a big dude. Value, and quality. My two favorite things, for the moment.
Worst customer service i have ever had. Cant believe this place is reviewed so high. They should seriously change out the staff. The food was okay not as good as i expected it to be based off the reviews. Expecially since this place has been reviewed by food critics (Howard Seftel to name one) which i think might have been paid off by this restaurant. That critic must have not been a true food critic and is most likely looking for a free meal because this place is at best a 3 star and thats if the staff had any normal manners.

I've been going there for some time now... probably nigh on a year. Somehow, in all this time of getting lunches there, I managed to overlook the roasted pork with plum sauce. NO LONGER will I make such a mistake! I feel like I have an orgy of flavor in my mouth right now. Seriously, this is good. I don't know what they did to it. Maybe I'm delusional. Maybe I'm just really really hungry.... whatever it is, I am in love with this food right now.

Horrifying!

Hong Kong Chinese Cuisine is the new kid on the block, replacing the old "Yu's Cafe" located inside an old Taco Bell building on the NorthWest corner of 19th Ave and Thunderbird. We dug the old Yu's Cafe, and were disappointed in its disappearance, so we gave the new guys a shot and ordered some delivery yesterday.

It's right off the casino, but you feel a world away because the decor is so nice. it's very authentic as well, with dishes like gai lan (chinese broccoli) and soup dumplings. 
Wow sorry for short jog I just took way off path of this review but it is spot on the truth. Da Sheng has been perfect about customizing our orders and keeping it fresh and hot for everything they have done. Why have basically made Da Sheng our go to place for Chinese food. This is now the official Wonton soup craving cure.
We also tried a hot pot dish - beef with eggplant, a shrimp dish with ginger and  snap peas, bok choy with garlic, they comp'd a nice plate of duck with boiled peanuts and a chicken / potato soup - the broth was very flavorful.  
I don't care if it's authentic or not, what's important to me is how good is it.  It is so good I find it hard to eat Chinese food anywhere else.
It took quite a bit of time to get our drinks and appetizers out to the table but the real disaster came with the time we had to wait for our entrees. Between finishing our appetizer and receiving our entree plates, it had to be at least 45 minutes. In that time we saw multiple tables get up and leave due to not having any service, which at first was amusing, and then turned to annoyance. 
I got the combination (chicken, beef and shrimp) friend rice as an entree and three Chinese spring rolls as an appetizer. The spring rolls were freshly prepared and were delicious! What really got me was my entree! It was cooked to perfection in my opinion. With a few dash of soy sauce and some chili sauce, my entree was completed! 
The wonton soup was EXACTLY what I needed. I walked here easy from Treasure Island. It's kinda funny to find, you have to walk through the bar. It was seriously the coolest things ever. I think it goes something like this:

All of the negative reviews do not surprise me. I once found a piece of broken glass in my Beijing Beef, about the size of a grain of rice. Nearly ate it but felt it at the last second. 
Coming from NY, I'm used to amazing chinese food and this place was only okay at first. We've ordered a few times since and its been greasier and greasier. My husband loves chinese food, so he just won't let it go. 


Sizzling Beef - very good, tender meat with a thick Chinese gravy.
My bf ordered chicken dishes.  The 1st time he ordered the orange chicken.  I tried it and it was ok, but 1 bite was enough for me and I ended up sharing some of my tofu dish with him.  The 2nd time he ordered yellow curry chicken.  It was bland in every aspect,  The color of the curry sauce was dull, the spice and flavor of the curry was light, and the consistency of the curry sauce was watery.  The chicken had a weird taste and texture and he ended up only eating a few bites and I had to give up a big portion of my tofu.  Later that night he started complaining about not feeling well, and ended up getting sick.  He normally has a strong stomach.
Very detailed and nice presentation... a little bit pricey for Vegas. It's unlikely I'll eat there again, but it's worth it to try it for a special occasion.
