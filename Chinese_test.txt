Hong Kong station brings Hong Kong to Madison! 
Argh.
Everything I have eaten has been very good.  I tried the beef chow fun, general tso's chicken, beef with broccoli, chicken with broccoli, and some other dishes.  I also like their pork egg rolls and pork fried rice.  This is a small place where one would usually get take out from.
Eclectic (but down-to-earth), Upbeat, Friendly, Inexpensive, Near-healthy (see menu), Kid-friendly, Fast, Clean, Variety.
 I'm glad they're not close or I would be in trouble
Avoid this place because bad and pricy food! We had the worse Shaw-Long-Bau with $3 each ($12 for 4).
A very solid Chinese takeaway, and definitely much better than most! Whereas it's Indian cuisine that holds my heart, who doesn't enjoy the occasional Chinese? But so many are sub-par, so New Haven Express Chinese was a great find.
I started going here since the place opened a few years ago. There was no other Chinese place in Surprise (that I knew of) at the time. Oil is definitely a main ingredient in their dishes. The beef dish I had once was pretty bad and never ordered it again but always loved the orange chicken with lo mein noodles. Lunch specials are pricey. Now that I'm a vegetarian, I have better options so I've never went back. The owner is friendly but always on the phone taking orders. They don't take American Express.
This was all of our first time to China Grill and our waiter was very helpful.  The restaurant is family style, which was great because we all got to try so many dishes.  We took our waiter's recommendation and ordered 4 appetizers and 5 entrees.  He doubled some of the appetizer orders so that we would have enough for us to share.
Both times we visited we did feel that the service dropped off a little bit towards the end.  They clear away well, but then they left us a bit and didn't ask about dessert, so we just asked for the bill.  To be fair our second visit was the Saturday after Valentine's, and it was full.
Fairly busy even on a weekday night.  Good food.  The green curry is quite spicy, but delicious.  I like that you can get brown rice instead of white rice.
Secondly, the food is solid and you cant beat the price for the portions you get. I have ordered many items off the menu and I have never run in to a bad one yet. Its solid, not amazing, blow your doors off, have a religious experience kinda food, its just a solid little place. You get your moneys worth. 
The food is good, the service so so . I have heard so many good things about this place that maybe I was dissapointed when I was not overly impressed with it.
Haters be damned, Panda Express satiates my light lunch cravings on a budget. Near my work and located inside Vons, I'm able to get a large serving of steamed veggies with vitamins, minerals, and fiber a la carte for about $3.60. Every visit the worker has to cook a fresh batch because they never have any on standby. I'm guessing nobody orders veggies. I totally don't mind. I would gladly have a freshly cooked garden over semi-old, sitting over the hot-ass steam veggies that nobody wants any day.
I hope this helps with your decision. Usually no waiting here. 
4. You are paying $6-12 for food. It is not going to be high end Chinese cuisine.
1 star:
Average americanised Chinese.   My girlfriend and I have ordered take out numerous times.   This last time we both ordered the sesame chicken dinner special with an egg roll.   After about 8 hrs we both became violently ill.   I have had diagnosed food poisoning before and this was it.   My guess would be the egg rolls.   Again this was an isolated incident, but we will not be eating here again.
Over all a wonderful dining experience. Chinese with a modern concept and I like it! I will be back.
It's with pleasure I write this review.  Not out of cruelty but out of moral duty to my fellow Yelpers.  Had I checked out Yelp beforehand, it would have saved me (and my family) frustration.
OMG! This is the WORST "Chinese" food I have ever had! I tried the 2 item combo plate with sesame chicken and orange chicken. It came with lo-mein and a veggie egg roll. Both chicken items were OBVIOUSLY leftovers from another time. DISGUSTING. Egg roll was soggy and tasted weird and the lo-mein, which they called chow mien, but it wasn't, was barely warm and tasteless. Everything you touched inside the restaurant felt sticky and greasy. Took one bite of each item and there it all away.
- Hot and Sour Soup
I was done eating within 20 minutes and made it back to the appointment with no problems. I hope to try this place again.
Liked it, didn't love it. Room is cool, with giant fish tanks and contemporary decor. Service was efficient, not friendly. Food was tasty but nothing special. And it was expensive. I ordered tea, sparkling water, Shu Mai and Kung Po chicken. 50 bucks with tip.
Overall we had a good meal and it wasn't pricey. 
Delicious, always my go to place for delicious, non-greasy chinese food in Madison!
Really probably 3.5 stars, but the service was beyond exceptional.
I didn't want to tell anybody... because I won't enjoy waiting in the future lines.
Amazing dumplings.  Like 4.5 on the dumplings.
Great little neighborhood place. We typically order delivery and they are prompt, friendly, and always include plenty of sauces and won ton strips. Our regular order is gang pang chicken, veggie fried rice with extra egg and they throw in some free crab puffs. I crave the crab puffs once a week.We have had several other dishes and they have always been fresh and delicious. If they ever add mu-shu to the menu I'll add a fifth star.
Overall, I am super pleased w/ this place. I am definitely a loyal customer.
As you can see, we're literally surrounded by the stuff.  But that's no reason to turn a blind eye, keep consuming, and "hope" everything will be OK.
After we were done, yep you guessed it, waited forever for the check.  No excuse for a place with people at only 10% of the tables.
Pics attached, looks are deceiving!
The food was worthwhile but I don't know if I could take the slow service again.
shanghai lo siu (beancurd w pork)
The Chicken Teriyaki is great!
I created this panda on yelp due to I'm a big yelper and to let people know this panda is a hit or miss. All depends on the chief in the kitchen, also if they are busy or not. If they have a good chief and are busy your food with be very hot tasty and fresh. Other times not so much even with busy n bad chief. They do accept military and police discount witch is nice since a lot of places in the Mesa area of river view don't.
My favorite items- The house chicken, chicken corn chowder soup, pillow chicken,  ma po tofu, sizzling rice soup, black pepper beef, and the sichuan prawns. 
Food is consistent but the portions are sort of small for the price. One of my favorite things that is hard to find is the shrimp toast. If you have never tried it, try these they are crispy and delicious. It is the closet I could find to mandarin style Chinese food here in my area. The lemon Chicken is also very good.
-Lobster
PROS:
Lol anyhoo this place had very good orange chicken, fried rice and low mein and egg flower soup best I've tried since getting to this hot state, I didn't like the eggs rolls though it was to doughy instead of the crispier wraps the use.  But overall excellent food kudos!!
We ordered:
Ive read the past reviews n decided to eat here. I honestly had better chinese food than this. Had some pork hash n it was so fatty and oily. Also had shrimp with honey walnut and the shrimp was way over cooked. I also had beef broccoli and it was not fresh broccoli it was the frozen ones that u buy in the bag n the dish served only 5 broccoli. Lemon chicken was so thin should of been called thin slice lemon chicken. Portion size were very small and the food was overcooked. The only positive thing I can say was the water service; the server made sure our glass was full. My husband and I are very disappointed. Will not be returning. Maybe thats why we were the only customers in there.
SPECIALS!!! They have lunch and dinner combos that come with so much food I always have lunch the next day, two meals for the price of one!
Good food, great ambience, but can be easily made at home for a lot cheaper. Milk tea with boba was good.
Seriously, the best Chinese food I have had in Arizona. This place is like a diamond in the rough. We had the Orange Chicken, Beef Chow Fun, and the soup of the day (daikon and pork I believe). Absolutely delicious! The place was constantly filled with people. The service was spectacular. 
Minus 1 star for crunchy rice.  What is it about Chinese restaurants with crunchy rice?
Love this place! It's super quiet, nice staff, excellent food and very reasonable prices! Will definitely return again.
Fried Rice
I'm from Philly where we have Dim Sum Garden, home to the best pork soup dumplings ever created: slurpy hot soup in moist delicious sacs with a morsel of pork in the center.  These dumplings had good taste, but their skin was wet and soggy.  There was not soup to slurp from them -this I consider to be a deal breaker.  The lack of dumpling sauce I have grown used to.  Be that as it may the worst part of the meal was the scallion pancakes, or green onion -however you call it- they were horrible.  They weren't crispy and flakey but doughy and tasteless.  This is why I'm so amazed it has gotten such great reviews, but then again, I was only judging this place on said items.  Maybe they have much better stuff?  Anyways  almost every restaurant in phoenix has 4 stars.
- the beef wasn't the best quality and they were sitting in way too much soy sauce.  They also weren't that spicy.  I have had better dumplings, in general, from Trader Joe's.
Omg I thought I could handle spicy. Dayum even #3 level kicked my @$$. I swear that I usually handle hear very well but definitely get 2 if you're not sure. It's not spicy at all but at least you can breathe!
I was super excited to try a new place. My family told me about this place and thinking that it was new to all of us, I agreed. I was a little cautious because of their reviews. We went during lunch time on a weekday and the place was pretty empty. The waitress quickly seated us. She was very prompt with taking out orders. I can't exactly remember the dish I had, but it came with a little bit of everything. I will be the first to say that I am a very picky eater and I cleared my plate. I was very impressed with my meal. I would def. go back and try another meal for sure. Pricing was decent too! Not too expensive for the amount of food you get. Plus when my brother asked, they gave us extra fortune cookies! This place gets an A from me!
Always great good, drinks, and service! Chic and relaxing atmosphere and always clean. The kitchen was behind on our last visit and our food took longer than usual, but the manager paid for it and apologized.
Although one might argue that you can get Chinese food for much less in Chinatown, do understand that their version is a bit more sophisticated. They use wagyu, truffles, abalone, etc. which aren't cheap. You're also paying for the location and ambiance.
This was my first time and certainly will not be my last!
Had some soy chicken, it wasn't very good.  Chicken came out a little cold and flavorless.  The other guys seemed to enjoy their meals.
- definitely do a plate from the cold deli counter and make sure you get something with the Sichuan peppery oil whether it's beef tendon or even just the cold chicken with the oil... it's a true slice of Sichuan
It's hard to find Good Chinese. Then factor in Az, then factor in I just moved to Tolleson. I thought I would be sentenced to cook everyday for the remainder of my days here. I rely heavily on reviews and then I debate. Well low and behold this place is great! I ordered pork fried rice and added shrimp, sesame chicken, and orange chicken. Omg so good! Plus, really nice workers. I was shocked. Two empressive things happened while I waited for my order. First, there was a sassy (atitudey) customer and this server did not flinch. She smiled and took care of the peach. I was so expressed. Second, the delivery guy hustled like he was on fire to get the order out. I mean he literally ran to his car. I was like, "dam that's how get it out to the customer". I usually don't write good reviews because in my experience customer service is rare if not dead.  This place made me so happy I had to let you know. Go get you some!
The juicy pork dumplings were not the business and the rest were meh. I've had better at small hole in the wall places in vegas.
Appeteizer - Shrimp & Scallop Lettuce Wrap 
My husband and I returned to Imperial Garden for dinner with our children. We were there on a Friday night. There was a bit of a wait (about 20 min), but nothing out of the ordinary for a Friday night around 5:30 pm. We had another great experience. We found IG family friendly and able to accommodate our two children without disturbing any other guests. Our five year old loved the experience and the food as well. And as parents know, if your children are happy, you are happy. We ordered the (very affordable I might add) lo mein for our daughter. It was good and there were plenty of leftovers between the lo mein and the two entrees we ordered.
Our "regulars" are the House Pan-fried Noodles, XO Beans, and the Walnut Shrimp. But on our last trip, a new discovery was made; the Salt and Pepper Pork Chops. It is to die for. In Hawaii, there is a place called "Little Village" who has a killer S&P Pork Chop, but, alas, it is no match for this one. If I wasn't so full from all the other delectable offerings, I'd have inhaled the last two pieces!
So we ordered the Beef Stew Noodle and the Spicy Yunnan Rice Noodle Soup. Wasn't expecting much, how authentic could it be on the strip? But, I was pleasantly surprised! 
The teriyaki beef was incredible, and not at all what I was expecting.  Instead of chopped beef in the thick teriyaki glaze I'm accustomed to, theirs was a thinner marinade that soaked completely through the meat.  Every piece was consistently tender and loaded with flavor.  I'd never had teriyaki of this caliber, and definitely didn't expect it from a little hole in the wall like this. Paid 8.95 for an order that could easily feed two with leftover.
I will definitely eat here again!
1.Quote "They'd have to have q driver come pick up the food in order to prove that it was bad. "
I grow up in Hong Kong so you can imagine how exciting I was when I found this place. Ya sure, lot of place served Cantanese style dishes in town. But to find that East meet West Hong Kong style cuisine, now that's a challenge. I'm talking about curry fish balls, street style wings and even HK style milk tea. Yummy and cheap, that's what it's all about. Don't forget the super yummy Mango desert and Shaved Ice. What better way to beat the desert heat but with a large bowl of shaved Ice top with fruit and sweet condensed milk. Did I mention HK peeps love their sweet :) Yup, brought back lot of fond childhood memory. Good Time ^_^
Yummy! Veggie egg rolls are excellent - really interesting, complex flavor. Egg flower soup is full of vegetables and is a lot heartier than I expected.
My little Sister ordered Mongolian beef which was OK, but there must have been one whole onion cut up in it and the ratio to meat was beyond ridiculous!!! 
I had driven past this place on Charleston on several occasions, and finally decided to give it a try on 9-5-2012.  I was a little disappointed in the variety of food was my first opinion but went to sample  what was presented.  The fried rice was next to cold and was greasy and had no flavor...as a matter of fact...the majority of the food was not heated to the point that I thought the health department would probably shut them down if they inspected.  The black pepper chicken was bland.  The Generals Chicken was stale.  I tried some french fries and they were cold, old, chewy and very bad.  All of the food I tested was either cold, bland, except for one dish that was hot, which must have recently been added to the line.  The resturant was very dirty.  The floor looked as though it had never been waxed and may have been a very long time since it was mopped.  There was food along the edges of the wall and along the bottom of the booths that had not been swept up and appeared to be there for a while.  As I looked around the floor it was evident that no one cared about cleanliness.
-The broth was amazing. Let me explain this a tad bit, I'm one of those people that love love being able to taste the natural flavors from my food. Although i do enjoy heavy, flavor enhanced broths that mask the natural taste of the meat, veggies, and other substances sometimes, for the most part, I think food taste best when you can actually TASTE it. With that being said, the broth was perfectly seasoned and definitely not overbearing.
We finished off our meal with two desserts 'PB&J' which is a peanut butter parfait. It was a five-star upgrade of any peanut butter delicacy that you have had in your life. It had sour cherry jam, banana & passion fruit sorbet. What an explosion of flavors!! We also had the Exotic Fruit Platter. The plate presentation was a work of art. Too bad I was too busy eating to take pictures!!
I'm not sure what make me keep coming back, but I just really dig the place. The staff is friendly, food is made quickly, and it tastes good- guess that does it! I guess you could say I'm a chile-head, and they do a good job making my dishes extra spicy when I ask.
I have been here several times and LOVE it!! Ordering delivery for the first time. Took my son who is a HUGE guy (football) player and he consumed every single piece of rice on his plate! Am a big fan of this place.
All I can say is yum!!!! I came here today for dinner with my hubs and I am already craving more. I asked him if we could come back tomorrow night. He said yes because Panda Express is not only affordable, it is delicious. I like to get the chow mein even though it is not the healthiest dish on their menu. That's why I also got the shiitake kale chicken breast. Delicious! Highly recommend.
Food ranged from ok to wonderful. Service was horrid. They place looked and felt dirty. We found hair in our food. The green tea was brewed in back and brought out. It was the color and temperature of lukewarm water without the flavor. Of the five of us not one plans on returning.
The last time I went in was a really negative experience. I ordered the orange chicken with white rice and an extra order of the white rice. All was fine until they brought out the orange chicken with no rice at all. They said they didn't have any white rice. I'm not sure why they didn't tell me that from the beginning especially since I asked for an extra order of it. The problem was this, they had plenty of white rice but since so many people call their orders in and pick it up, they gave the rice to them. They had the rice that I ordered, I know this because my sister-in-law (whom I turned on to this place) actually came in when my food was delivered to the table without the white rice. I ended up just leaving the place after paying for my crab puffs and I text my sister-in-law to see if they got white rice. Yep, they sure did. 
We were looking for some good chinese food after eating all american and mexican cuisine for our trip  found this place through yelp.  If you are looking for good authentic Chinese food, this is the place to go.  Good menu selection and reasonable priced,
Spicy Shrimp in Shell
I will be back.
I've taken a lot of people to China Buffet and everyone liked it except for one friend who thought their abolone was gross... but abolone IS gross... regardless of where it comes from. 
Although it's a little pricy for the serving size it's define rely authentic to the city of Changsha in Hunan Provence. 
We had the Beef Pie, Pork Pie, Pan Fried Chives Pocket, Spicy Beef and Tendon, Spicy Bean Curd and all were very tasty.  The noodles in the Soybean Paste and Beef Noodles were very authentic, al dente, paste and beef pretty good as well.
Last year when I came to Vegas, I had the best wonton soup (at least in the west coast) in the Buffet in Wynn. Since then, I had cravings for the soup again and again. Born in Hong Kong, I was not able to find the same quality of wonton soup in the States. Expecting the same soup from Red 8, I have to say I was disappointed. 
Egg roll was typical.
The fried rice is like regular rice with some brown food coloring--disappointing for sure.
Being Vegas, there are a lot of authentic places and then there are a lot of pretentious places - you'll know where this belongs. Skip.
Much like it's former State Street counterpart, this place used to be awesome. The food is still good, but it's not so fast anymore and the ingredients seem to be a bit skimpy. My 10 Ingredient Fried Rice had about 4 shrimp. Lame. Still - it's all delicious. But I never used to have to wait 15 minutes and it all-around used to be shinier.
Running on only two hours of sleep and looking down the barrel of a full day by the pool drinking beers, somehow this seemed like a good idea.  Girlfriend and I ordered:
I will go back because I love the menu, the taste, and the prices.  But again his customer service really sucks big time.
I tried this place out with a few friends the other night for the first time... It was a great experience! The pot stickers are reminiscent of dim-sum in their shape and style, and they're very pleasant tasting in comparison to most other gyoza/dumpling appetizers, locally. 
stick to the szechwan beef noodle soup!!
3) Rice cake with pork.
My favorites are...
The only good part: the fortunes form the fortune cookies where really unique.
Woo's happy hour starts early (3ish) and ends at 6:30pm with specialty drinks half off and a variety of small dishes for reasonable prices. 
I did see a TV star sitting across from me. I'm sure she could afford to eat here more often than I.
Went here for the second time today. The food probably only rates a three, but the service definitely bumps it up a notch! They are so nice!! 
Didn't notice any dank smell as Korinna suggested.
They earned the extra half star...the offer duck sauce in packets! and you can order the fried rice without the carrots and peas.  They did a large "to go" order for me that I carried 300+ miles home and it held up amazingly!  Yum!
Minced beef stuff over rice: Really good. Not the taste I expected, but it grew on me.
What we ordered...
They accept CC but there's a .75 service charge - not sure if many know it's illegal for businesses to add service charges for card use but it is...considering the neighborhood I would be a little leery carrying cash in the area at night if you're not from those parts.
We were there this past weekend.  When I first tried the Braised beef noodle, it was actually OK.  My wife and I decided to go back for lunch the next day.  I ordered the same noodle - was disappointed because they made such a big deal about my request for egg noodle (which is what I ordered the day before).  They kept asking me who waited on us the day before.  Apparently, they try to discourage the customers from picking which type of noodle they preferred.  The chef disagreed with my choice and they were pushing for the hand-made spring noodle.  I went through 3 servers (who were extremely rude) until they figured out who waited on us the day before.  Naturally, I was upset and basically lost my appetite.  I don't know if they did it on purpose but the soup base tasted like it was watered-down.  No flavor at all as compared to the day before.  I told our server about all the hassle because of my request and she explained that the chef gives them a hard time if they request on behalf of the customer a different noodle.  It turns out, their chefs come directly from Northern China and they do not like it when customers want egg noodle in their soup (which I guess is Cantonese style from the Southern part of China - according to the waitress).  Anyway, long story short - the first few servers were very rude.  They had to get permission from the manager AND the chef if it was OK for me to pick which noodle I wanted for my soup.  To top it off, they were not consistent with the flavor.  Should have gone to Noodles at Bellagio.
I have no doubt that upon viewing the outside of Canton Dragon's building, many a customer has chosen to dine elsewhere. In fact, a couple of my friends are guilty of doing this! (The appearance on the inside isn't much better.) But don't let its appearance fool you. Yes, it is tiny. Yes, it looks uninviting. Yes, if I were the owner I would have relocated a long time ago or at least invested in some massive renovation! However, the inside is clean, and their food is delicious!
I can't say enough about this place.
(Good for: Breakfast___ Lunch___ Dinner___Brunch___Late Night___Dessert___Nothing_X_)
great food , great service !
You can order alcohol from Sonny Saloon 24/7
Orange Chicken itself....nothing to write home about. if i didn't actually look at each individual hunk of chicken and noticed that it's coated in sauce i would have assumed they missed some spots going by taste alone.
Blossom's interior is nice, but a little busy.  It fits in well with the rest of Aria.  We were seated right away.  The tables are fairly close together, and if it was really busy, it could have been a bit cramped.  But we didn't have that problem.  
You can get really good and cheap traditional Chinese food here. Their lunch special is awesome! $5 dishes and the portions are the same as dinner. They have about 60 items on their menu. And the lunch special is everyday from 10-3pm. I've included a picture of their menu here.
Great management here. Sometimes the new employees at the register are confused with the promotions, but the management always helps them. Sometimes customers slow up the line, but that's no fault of the staff.  It would be nice when the line backs up because a server farther down the line is refilling an item, that the available person in the earlier part of the line helps serve the waiting people.
I decided on the southeast asian peanut chicken with brown rice, which I really liked. The thing of rice they bring out is giant and could easily be split between two. My friend had the katsu chicken and said it was good, though he prefers their teriyaki chicken. We ended with the chocolate wontons which were good, but they sound better than they tasted.
My dining partner had never been to Yum Cha/Dim Sum before - she was impressed - and I must say it was a good introduction to Yum Cha quality-wise.
If you call Chinese dumplings by a Japanese spelling, that should tell you something. And ordering them steamed is a fail in itself, but that is user error, not a fault of the kitchen. 
And now ladies and gentlemen, the category tonight: Things that make Siu-Wok A-OK in my book.
The Flamingo Palace is my favorite Asian food restaurant.  A great family atmosphere but also a great place for date night.  Great food at a great price, Check it out if your in the area!!
If your hungry and dont have high expectations this is your place.
Good, healthy portions make it half the cost because it becomes two meals. Great place for a date or just sitting alone, moaning in pleasure, which is why they won't let me eat inside anymore.
Skewers - pleasantly seasoned, not overpowering and very well cooked and high  quality juicy meat. flavor as expected, five spice, cumin, light dusting of chili powder. 
This is my favorite Chinese restaurant!  
Boba drinks are available as well as the Taiwan shaved ice desserts.  Silken Tofu desserts are also a favorite with the crowd when the weather becomes quite warm.  
Then or food came. The food was great! All of it was well cooked, seasoned and had just the right amount of kick. I have nothing bad to say about the food at all. Except maybe less huge chunks of onion. But that is just personal taste. ;)
The menu is full of authentic american Chinese dishes with thick sauces and mild spices. We had the black tree mushrooms with bamboo shoots and snow peas, spicy bean curd, and egg foo young.   All of which were decent cooked well and drowned in thick sauces. The flavors were mild and offensive. This is the Chinese food that grandma remembers. 
I always have the hibatchi shrimp and scallops which is always TDF!  My boyfriend gets the fillet,chicken and shrimp....always great!!!!! LOVE this place! Also lots of fun to load up on drinks at the slot machines and then go for dinner!
Spicy Food!  Food to me was above average.  This is the first place that I have ever eat the spicy food this way.  It make your tongue tingle!  Perhaps we didn't know what to order and the waitress is NO help at all.  How can you work in a restaurant and don't even know what is good or popular and didn't even bother to find out for us.  In the end, we order some frog legs and the cold dish at the kinda like buffet station
This place is a hidden gem in my book! Definitely coming back!!
They are also happy to take additional meal requirements and even supply a bit of chili oil on the side if you ask them.
The decor is very hip and has a twinge of Chinese flair. The bathrooms are kind of awesome. They have individual television screens in the pod like shaped rooms-- it almost feels like you are inside an ipod. But I digress, we're here for the food. 
the food was steaming hot, fresh and was out in record time as well. What the place lacks in decor and ambiance, it more than makes up for in service, quality and cost!
Honestly, the front dining room is spotless and the waiters/waitresses are the most attentive (without being annoying) I've ever seen.  They're great.
Quick, cheap, and convenient. Greasy, but hey , you will be stuffed.
2) You're reeeeally craving Asian food. Like, really.
My friend ordered the Beef Chow Fun.  Even though the noodles were not made there, the dish was so good!  They made it exactly the way I like it....Cantonese style (dry).  The flavors were authentic and powerful.  The noodles were perfectly cooked and the beef was super tender.  This is the dish I would get if I find myself there again.
Used to get delivery from here years ago, but apparently they are now under new ownership and no longer deliver..my other half NEVER wants Chinese so when he agreed I had to take the time to go and pick it up..might not have the chance for Chinese for another 6 months. 
Went there with some friends. Our Chinese friend ordered from the Chinese menu but the American menu with the pictures also looks good. She didn't know about the Chinese menu (I told her!), she always orders from the American menu and was quite satisfied. The inside looks clean, not really your regular looking Chinese restaurant.  Service is a bit slow like some people remarked. They could be a little bit more "friendly". Food was very good, very hot. I will go back at lunch or with some family. 
I love the vegetable chow fun is my favorite thing to get. The New York eggs rolls are delicious.
Great service 
So, you have been walking the strip for hours and you finally took in the sites of the Venetian. What do you do now at the 5 star hotel but you don't have 5 star cash? Get a new job player! Just kidding. Hit the food court. My first choice would is the Deli for sure, but if the casino slots have left you with a few dollars short try Wasabi Jane's Rice & Noodle Works. 
Ping on opens late, and I mean late. It also delivers to Morningside so I am instantly a fan! We had a large order including crispy duck, squid, chinese greens, soups rice and the whole shebang. I cant comment on the restaurant having only had a takeout but that was tasty and fresh, and not gloopy and MSG-ified in that nasty cheap take out way. Try it!
The food was so bad. The meat quality was horrible and hardly edible. There are much better Chinese food places to try.
Carryout containers: They need stronger bags or to double bag orders as I've walked out wondering if the bag would hold up more than once. Rice comes in the classic paper box. But main dishes come in microwave ready black plastic containers that are so much better than the styrofoam you find elsewhere. 
Anyway, I had the wonton noodle soup. Simple enough, right? Wrong! The broth and noodles were nothing special, just what you'd expect. It came one one piece of vegetable. I mean come on, it's not too expensive to toss in another piece or two, right? But my real complaint comes with the wontons. They tasted like they have been sitting there for at least a week in the fridge and the meat has started to go bad. I couldn't even finish my first one.
Best Chinese Food I've ever had. Perfect portion sizes and loads of flavour.
This place is okay.  I REALLY want to find a good Chinese food place in the Old Town/South Scottsdale area, and I am still not in luck.  True, there is no atmosphere, but I don't really care.  Also true that the service is less than friendly.  Whatever-- I have lower expectations for a place from which I really only intend to mostly order takeout.
Well, wishes do come true because I was flipping through the 2010 best of Phoenix from New Times earlier this week and China Magic Noodle House was in there as a place to try so today, after watching the early screening of the movie Social Networking, I headed over to Chandler to try it out. I was pleasantly surprised to see it in the same shopping center as Lee Lee's, an Asian market that people have been telling me to check out for ages.
The chili wings are otherworldly. The chili dumpling are equally amazing. In fact, order every last dumpling on the menu. You get 6 dumpling for $1.75, and they have half a dozen kinds! The chicken eggplant is perfect. And I dare you to try to spend more than $10 even stuffing yourself like it's Thanksgiving Day. You can gut FULL - entree, drink, tax, for $5 with no problem.
Horrible service, mediocre food,$25 credit card minimum. Everytime i come to this place it takes forever for my food to come and they never give me the check when im done. Id have to go up to the front counter to pay. The thing is it was never busy at all! The only great thing about this place is daily lunch specials.
Great buffet with just the right amount of selection for the stir fry section and finger foods. When I'm hungry all I want is a steaming plate of stir fry noodles and some of those crab puffs!
Pork Fried Rice - received a container of sticky, mushy, overcooked white rice - again flavorless, with some peas, carrots and a few shreds of unidentifiable white meat.
Used the for a new years eve open house and my guests loved the food..I had orange chicken, mushroom chicken and walnut shrimp and chow mien noodles..excellent choice for a buffet.
Cumin Flavored Lamb
Currently my order of choice is the walnut shrimp. It's fried, covered in a sweet sauce and served with broccoli. My husband always orders Orange beef because he likes his beef fried and crisp (not on the menu). 
It impressed me that they deliver for only 1 dollar with a min of 13 bucks. Cheap!!
I think they may deep-fry all their stuff in the same grease because sometimes you could taste a hint of shrimp. 
-Barbecued salmon was a disappointment - it was way overcooked and dry.
Did I mention how good the wonton and beef noodles were?!  Love the soup part; excellent use of stock.  Loved the noodles!
too easy. DO NOT eat here. 
Personal recommendation: get the chicken wings. I'm convinced this place could survive as a chicken wing joint. So crisp and delicious. I will be back :]
I am a lover of Chinese food, and am always on the prowl for a tasty new place that is close. This place fit the bill nicely!
Interior was tacky, run-down and just plain sad.
Another fine review by S.G.
Excellent service, you are always greeted at the door and never have to ask to a refill. Great Chinese food in general, comes out quick for those in a hurry. Also, I am more willing to drive across town just for their boiled wonton spicy peanut soup - phenomenal
Crispy Gau Gee Mein / Cake Noodles devine!! there is no place where you can get this stuff except for some chinese restaurants in Hawaii.. 
Let's just say after driving home from Vegas I reached my house super hungry. My roommate just kept talking about how she had previously that morning ordered Pong Pong and could not stop raving about how cheap it was for how much food she got. So I went for it... I ordered the beef and brocoli and they delivered it directly to my front door. The serving was huge and I am super impressed with how good it actually was. I had yet to find a good chinese place that I would return to until I had Pong Pongs so give it a chance.
Service is friendly and awesome.
Products: Great variety of dishes compared to other similar places around.  Everything we had tried in this place had been Great. 
Authentic. 
Overall, there was nothing offensive about it, there simply wasn't any flavor to the Kung Bo Chicken with Fried Rice.  For something that is so unhealthy for you (ala Carry Out Chinese), I expect it to at least be flavorful.  Unfortunately, it was just incredibly bland and boring.  I did my best to kick it up a notch with hot chili sauce, I even added some soy, which I never do.  In the end, it just wasn't great.  
I truly wasn't impressed with either. Not that they're awful-just lacking in flavor. The chicken fried rice has little bits of onion and chives mixed in with it which was fantastic. I was quite disappointed in the sesame chicken. There's really no flavor to it. Not crisp. It's truly nothing special and I wouldn't order it again. 
Since my husband had such a positive experience the first time he went, I am willing to give this place another try.  Maybe they just hired a new chef (our server said that he was also brand new) so there may be some inconsistencies in the menu.
All the dishes tasted the same.
I am not saying this was the best Szechwan beef noodle soup I have ever had in my life but during that moment, after a night of heavy drinking, it was perfect. Usually, pho would do the trick, but I think this will be my new hangover meal.
************************* What does my OVERALL rating mean?*************************
We searched for this place for hours and unfortunately it wasn't worth the search. We waited 20 minutes and were seated in the middle of an intensely bright white room. The television was on a novela with no sound, I'm sure it was earlier on a World Cup game but still weird. We ordered pot stickers, mushu pork, and chicken fried rice. Pot stickers took forever, we were warned about that but still. They were ok, nothing special or great. Mushu pork and rice was gross, I only ate it because I was starving. The meat was just blah. I'm ok with different, which is was from Chinese food I've ate before, but this didn't even taste good at all. The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us. Don't waste time going here.
Also, Chinese isn't my favourite cuisine so I guess that does taint it slightly. Perhaps lovers of Chinese food (as some of the other high raters may be) might like it better? Just make sure you're patient!
Average Chinese, not bad but it would be so easy to make it better! Strip prices, above strip-average portions.
Looking back, I realize that I am really bad at describing flavors. How did I get to be Elite again?
This used to be our regular payday Friday lunch spot, so I have a lot of experience with the lunch menu and the service. However, that was when one of our lunch crew was a guy who wouldn't venture out of a 5-mile radius for lunch and was a pretty simple eater. That guy has moved on and our options for lunch have expanded, so it had been a while... today, a few of us decided to pay our respects. 
In this case, the Yelp general rating and reviews here have let me down.  Nothing about Mr. Beijing was above average, I'd actually put it a little below average. They meet about what I expect for this kind of place if they are not preparing food to order.  It all tasted like buffet food that just came out of a warming tray.  The service was incredibly fast which is telling that they weren't actually cooking it to order. Stale & flavorless, barely warm, and didn't look particularly appetizing.  Generally sesame chicken is not quite so yellow, it looked more like lemon chicken with sesame seeds, but it was definitely an attempt at Sesame chicken, but the meat was stale and had an odd flavor and the sauce didn't taste like what I've come to expect and again, was mostly flavorless. The most surprising thing to me was the white rice, it was actually undercooked and crunchy. Or maybe it was dried out and overcooked from sitting around too long.  I have never had a low-end chinese restaurant screw up white rice.  I'll at least give them 2 stars because other than the rice it wasn't inedible.  I probably should only give them a single star because in my home city, a 4 star rating on a place like this would be a neighborhood favorite that cooks everything to order, and a place producing food of the quality I experienced at Mr. Beijing would only be visited by folks who don't know any better. Vegas seems to have high end overpriced places o' plenty, so I expected the standards for lower end stuff to be a bit higher.  I'm disappointed that I was wrong about that.
At other restaurants like Hong Kong Gourmet on Dobson they give you the skin and the meat. I asked the waitress and she said that's all it comes with. Needless to say this dish will not be receiving another review next time. Also the food took at least 45 minutes to come to our table, and I notice it was like that at the other tables as well. I'm not sure if I will be giving it a second chance next time around.
Since our move to the south west valley, my family had been looking for a good chinese restaurant.  I found this restaurant from yelp and other sites and true to form...the reviews pretty much sum up wongs on indian school.  Located on the north side of indian school across from the chase bank..in a dainty strip mall...it sits next door to an unknown bookstore with the most inconsistant store close times...sometimes its open....other times...nope.  anyway.....as you walk into wongs, there is a front table with a  register and an older asian lady that looks very judgemental...the truth of the matter is..she probably is...but who cares, im there to eat!  My family and i go at least once every week or two.  We usually have the chinese eggplant with beef special and my kids devour the lemon chicken.  I once tried the spicy beef with mushrooms...delicious.  i also had experimented with the chicken corn soup....delicious.  you cant really go wong with wongs..give it a try!
Not high on ambiance, but consistent quality. We order from here a few times a month.
We started with a BBQ Pork Appetizer which was very good. For my entree I had a cup of Wonton Soup (wasn't that hungry).  Mr R ordered Cha Tsai which were veggies with pork over noodles.
They offer a lot of specials known only to locals, like cheaper lobster between 3-5pm and late night happy hour on food. You also get a free steamed chicken if you order the crab and have more than 4 people eating.
I think I will read through some reviews and take some pointers on what to order and go back.
I think if you're looking for general American-Chinese fare, a lot of food, at a decent price, then it's okay.  I emphasize though that there are much better choices around.
- MUST-HAVES: Ribeye noodle soup, Stir-fried beef, Seafood & tofu claypot.
It's my favorite Chinese resturant great food and great quality sour chicken 
Siu Wok has become a favorite of my colleagues and I as of late. They offer the standard items you'd find at any Chinese restaurant and that's about it. They do it and do it well. Plus they deliver ($15 minimum order), which is of the utmost important when shackled to a workstation 8 hours a day or more. If you can get an order pulled together by 3pm, the offering of lunch combo specials can't be beat. 25 entrees with a side of rice, an eggroll and 2 crab puffs, most combos costing $5.95.
* Wonton noodle soup - comfort food.  Great when trying to sober up.
There was a steady flow of people moving in and out of the place, even at 1pm.
I used to work in the business and I come from a family of chefs, this restaurant should be shut down. DISCUSTING
This is our favorite take out place.  The food is always fresh, flavorful and plentiful.  The owners are very nice also.  We drive out of the way for take out from them.
"Recently refurbished Chinese restaurant in an old part of town."
My husband, daughter and I showed up at 1:00 am on our way home.  We were greeted by a Mexican....in a Chinese restaurant.  The other 5 Asians that work there were setting at a table by the kitchen.  I am not exaggerating when I say they STARED at us the entire time.  It was uncomfortable to say the least.  We were all very nicely dressed and polite.  We ordered three appetizers and three drinks.  The spring rolls were brought out to us burned.  I asked them to please bring us some that was not burned.  The waiter was not rude but when he came back he said the kitchen would not remake them and he would take them off of the bill.  The staring continued!   The food was good that wasn't burned which is the only good thing I can say.  The appearance of the restaurant is questionable and the dead fish in the dirty tanks at the entrance should have made us turn around and leave!  After we left we found out the from 10:00 pm - 2:00 am you get 20% off of your bill.....guess what.....we didn't receive that either!  This was the most uncomfortable eating experience I have ever had.  I don't understand the staring for the entire 45 minutes we were there!  We will never go back to this place!
Maybe I ordered the wrong things...  maybe I was there on an off night...  
Their delivery people are always courteous and happy to serve even though I live on the most annoying 3rd floor of my apartment complex! I have always received my food fast and hot.
In addition to the food being awesome when we got home, it took less than 10 minutes from ordering to get our order. They also deliver so we will be checking that out next time. Thank you yelpers for such a great suggestion. 
While it is a bit pricey, you get what you pay for in service and quality, and to be honest, it wasn't unreasonably priced. 
It doesn't look like much on the outside, or on the inside for that fact, but it makes up for that in food quality, price, and service. 
This is the worst place ever for Chinese food. My boyfriend who is full Chinese couldn't even stomach more than four bites. The food was worse than Americanized Chinese. It smelled bad, tasted like greasy feet, and was just not fresh or hot. The price is cheap but I guess you get what you pay for.
Amazing flavors, lots of good spice, inexpensive. Great place, will definitely frequent!
I've been to China three times now and spent fourteen weeks there in total, so I definitely know what Chinese food should taste like. Asian Cafe Express is the most authentic Chinese food I have found in America. The restaurant itself reminds me of how many restaurants are in China, from the pictures of the dishes on the wall, to the spicy sauce sitting on the table. The dishes seem to mostly represent the styles of Southern China and Hong Kong, which makes sense because most of the staff comes from those regions. 
Being local, family owned with a huge menu its a win win win for everyone!
The crab puffs were decent. But, really, don't. Get Thai.
The Hot and Sour Soup is always good, and at times it is excellent.  We do see some variation in flavor, but we always start our meal with it.  Even on an "off day" it is still good.  You hit the Hot and Sour Soup JACKPOT when it has that perfect balance of heat (from black pepper) and dark vinegar, along with the meats and veggies.  I tend to discern Chinese restaurants by their Hot and Sour Soup, and this version rarely disappoints.
Jumbo Poached Shrimp, Brandy-Spiked Cocktail
Yelpers, I tried it based on your reviews and I'm so glad you are all right--this may look like a hole on the wall but it's far from it. The restaurant has nice seating and great staff. I love the fact that the cooks and staff speak Cantonese. It's a sign that the food is genuine. The prices are ridiculously cheap! Walnut shrimp was only 9.95!!! Everywhere else sells for 14 and up. 
This sit down Chinese Restaurant is near my school where the majority of teachers get their lunch fix. I joined some of them during a summer planning day. The restaurant is small, but the service is big. You can usually hit or miss with Asian service. Why do I say that? Because I'm Asian. Although they are friendly, smiles all around, and know their repeat customers.
Service was a bit off but it was the 25th of Dec they were busy and I imagine their A crew had the day off.
What a let down. Fin used to be our favorite restaurant in Vegas. We ignored the recent reviews and went anyway. Even with a smaller post-Labor Day crowd, the service was not what we were used to. Servers didn't seem to want to be there and certainly didn't care about our experience. Lemon chicken was overcooked and very tough. Beef in the beef and broccoli was chewy and without flavor. We won't go back until we see that they have returned to the level of service and quality they once had.
They offer delivery so call to check the areas they cover. You can also place your order for pick-up if you don't want to dine inside. They have lunch specials that range in price from $7.95, $8.95, $9.95 and $10.95 depending on what you order and it includes soup, egg roll and choice of steamed or egg fried rice.
Love Li's bowl I'm a regular and will continue to be. My faves are the broccoli beef and the chicken lo main. I've been coming here since they opened and they are always happy and friendly.
The clay pot casseroles are specialties that will warm your heart on the coldest of days. Generous portions are usually enough for more than one serving. The lamb and radish casserole had a heap of tender meat on a bed of noodles, radish, tofu, mushrooms, and cabbage in tasty broth. They also serve hot pot. 
They served the soybean soup 10 minutes before the donuts.  WTF they're pairs.
I've eaten at this place almost once a week since it has opened.   Everything I've eaten has been of good quality, cooked properly, decent portions, reasonable prices and the service has been very accomodating.  I have been given free extras at times, ordered extra sauce when I've carried out at a fair price.  Delivery to my home has always been fast and the food always has arrived hot.  The place has 4 booths and 4 tables and at times are crowded but I've always found a seat.  The food is excellent  and is better than any resturant I've eaten at.  I love the Garlic Chicken and the sauce they serve with it.  It is a sweet and spicy sauce but I always get 2 extra containers of Chili Sauce as I like it even hotter.  If you want excellent food at very reasonable prices,  give this place a try, you won't regret it.
Basically, you can go to RA during happy hour and get more food for a cheaper price and enjoy the experience.  This place was way overpriced for the quality they deliver.  The quantity was ok, but the price did a lot more then they quality and not worth it.
On the contrary to other reviews on this place, hubby and I had a very pleasant experience.  There were no service issues, and the food, as noted in other reviews, is EXCELLENT.
I like this place. I placed an order to go. Service was quick and friendly and the place seemed pretty clean. The Hot and Sour soup was not very hot or sour (fixed with chili oil and white vinegar at home). The ingredients were quality though, you could tell the mushrooms were fresh and not from a can. The pork dumplings were clearly from scratch, and they were good. I ordered the spicy beef. It wasn't very spicy but the ingredients were quality again, seemed fresh and the veggies hand cut. Next time I'll ask for extra spicy and see how it goes.
              had! Almost addictive!
3) You don't mind paying well over $10 for noodles.
How can you not love a place that has $3.50 drinks with umbrellas and fruit garnishes and the best cocktail sign ever?! I have only ordered the drinks, the chicken wings and the pad Thai and I loved them all. So far, this is my favorite pad Thai in the valley. My husband likes Pei Wei's version better, which I don't understand . I order mine not too spicy here, because otherwise it is quite spicy!
I remember eating here 10 years back and really loved the food.  I suggested to my friend visiting from India to go to Jasmine.  We booked a table for 8.
The dishes we ordered were around $7 and the potstickers even cheaper. An unexpectedly great meal so far away from Spring Mtn Rd...and so much closer to home. I will be back.
I think what really makes this restaurant better than some of your other fast food Chinese type locations is their friendliness and service. Every order I have made whether it be take out or dine in has been correct and really quick. Even with young workers behind the register, they are on top of everything and pay attention to your order. The owner is usually on hand cooking or serving which gives it a local feel rather than a chain. 
Once we sat down, we ordered two rolls from the sushi menu. Both were unappetizing considering how hungry we were! I think I lost my appetite when I walked in - can someone find it? Oh, it's at the Beijing Noodle House No. 9 at Caesar's Palace. If you want to eat at a good noodle house, go there. Avoid this place!
My girlfriend and I eat "Rice n Noodle" pretty often. Most of the time it's delivery. We usually get the Dinner special that includes egg rolls, rangoon, soup, rice and 2 entrées with a delivery fee of $2(i think) it all comes out to be about $26 or $27. Their generous portions take us 3 meals to finish. The math . . 
1. The service is bad. Water didn't get refilled. The rice came long after the entree. 
I gave it 3.5 stars. I ordered the pan fried noodle with beef and egg sauce (like chow fun). It was a bit bland, but that was not a problem with a little pepper and chili. I like the price of all the food, and the portions were big. There was 5 of us, and we had 5 entrees and hot and sour soup.
The star of the meal for everyone at the table was the shrimp dumpling. The bite-size pockets of goodness were amazing and so full of flavor! Definitely a must try. 
Get a grip. I support Flo's because I really liked her Scottsdale location (the old one before she moved across the street) because beside better than PF Changs food and prices and her smiling attentiveness, she had real Serigraphs of Chinese Yunan (now Beverly Hills retired) artist Jiang (which made me like the place immediately, as I like him and own a Serigraph myself of his..."Running Horses"). 
Although those are the only two items we ordered, we will definitely be back to try other dishes, such as the fried intestine, and the fish...
I don't know why I keep eating at Panda.  I think I had good Panda once and I keep going back to repeat the experience but it's never good.  
The fish tasted fresh and the breading was crispy, but there was so much salt this dish was a little hard to keep eating. It tasted like this dish may have had a lot of MSG, not sure but you may want ask if it concerns you.
First of all, it's kinda hard to find as it's, like, a little hole-in-the-wall dwarfed by a much larger Goodyear store; however it's much larger than it looks from the outside.
So far, they have satisfied. The General Tso's is by far better than anything we have come across in Madison - and no, the chicken has not been spoiled for us. The battered coating before fry is not too heavy and the sauce has a little bit of heat. Personally I would like more chilis, but I realize that is an acquired taste. 
John got the porridge and gave me a sip.  It's got fish sauce already mixed in it so it's got a lot of flavor in addition to the other ingredients they added to it.  I was really impressed.  It's kinda hard to make a great tasting rice porridge bowl when by definition this is not the tastiest food.
We have visited many times and the service has always been great. The Kung Poa chicken is great. We keep trying new items and they are always very good.
I'm actually glad I went with the Singapore noodles instead, although in terms of flavor they weren't TOO much better
I wish I had listened to the negative reviews for once.
GROSS!!!!!
Lobster, house special with green onions and stuff. 
Sesame paste noodles was delicious 
Szechwan garlic chicken. Looked better than it tasted. Broccoli frozen prior to cooking, garlic non existent, and the sauce was more tasteless than Panda Express (the King of spewy Chinese food in my snobby opinion). 
Knowing that Panda Express just wasn't going to cut it for this craving, i went to my fellow yelpers for advice. I knew i wanted realllllly good Chinese good, i didn't care how much it cost. When i'm sick, i want what i want, and nothing else matters. However, i needed a place that delivered or i could go and pick up ASAP and Mr. Chao's was it!
Their Hong Kong style noodles were bland and undistinguished, with a strange little sweetness that I didn't care for at all. 
I've had the Thai fried rice twice and five other items on my other visits here.  I can't reiterate the friendliness of the staff here and the superb customer service.  I have no problem knowing I found a spot for great Thai fried rice.  I understand any type of food is subjective and would recommend everyone to stop here and try it out for yourself.
great oysters, good size shrimp and crab legs.
The food at this Panda Express is fine but the rice? Not so good. They can never get it right. I've been coming here for awhile but the rice is always undercooked. Come on if this is an Asian restaurant, you have to at least cook the rice right. Some days it's edible and some days it's so hard it's almost raw. I would give it 4 stars because they have great service but because of the undercooked rice I give it one star.
 Serves no alcohol but you can BYOB if you book in advance. Also does takeaway.
Ok a one star is pretty hard for me to write but geez.  First off this is chinatown?  Maybe I'm spoiled from being from SoCal and having our own chinatown or even just towns where asians have naturally gravitated to have built their own unofficial chinatowns.  Either way it's not their fault but you can easily drive past this place without even knowing you just went through chinatown.
I have to say, I'm a bit surprised by the low rating I saw. My fiance and I stopped by this place late one night.  We always saw it as we would walk to and from the Albertson's from our house and we wanted to eat some Chinese food.  Small place. The huge menu posted on the front of the establishment is nice.  Our first time walking to this place, we took our puppy so she could get some exercise, so the menu out in front was a good perk.  Their portions size was very generous. My fiance got the tofu with eggplant in garlic sauce.  Delicious! A bit spicy but not overwhelming.  I got the sweet and sour shrimp.  Again, portion was great.  I loved that they put the sweet and sour sauce on the side. I tend to eat in small portions, but all the time, which, if the sauce was already mixed in, the shrimp would have been super soggy.  This allows me to put how much sauce I want in and keep my food longer without worry of the soggy factor.  Another plus was that they have Honey Walnut Shrimp.  Yes, you can get this at many Chinese food establishments, but seeing as how I hate driving in Las Vegas and this dish tends to be pricey, I'm glad to find a place close-by that sells it for a decent price (less than $15).  Planning on coming back!
I've returned to this place 2 more times after my last review. Wait service was still inconsistent, especially with the dimwitted waitress.
hot and sour soup: ok... but i was starving and it was the first thing I ate all day
Ohhh the temptation was fulfilled!!
Getting obsessed with Sichuan food recently; this place is authentic and SPICY. Small and uncrowded, as close as In-N-Out and cheaper than Smashburger for lunch. Infinitely better and comparably priced to Panda in the SU. 
Now, out of all the places I've gone to this one came the closest to giving me the flavor I needed.  If you're a vegetarian, they can modify many dishes to suit your needs.  The hostess was very helpful!  Because of this, I am encouraged to go back and try more things.  No lunch specials for veggies tho.  I ordered a large size of Kung Pao Tofu with brown rice.  Yay for brown rice!  This is the FIRST place out here I've found that has it!!  The Kung Pao was a bit spicy for me, but that's how it's supposed to be.  I ordered it because it was the closest thing I could get to General Tso.  Their portions are large and the service was great.
Today, I actually called in for pick up. I only ordered soup cuz I'm sick. But the person who answered the phone was so friendly and understanding. He had asked if I was sick then he said that he was sick last week...and that there must be something going around. And before the conversation ended he said I hope you feel better. =)
This place has folded again.  The food was fine, but it's just a hopeless location for such a business!
My recommendations are the Sweet and Sour chicken, the Egg Foo Yung and the chow mein. You will not be disappointed.
We got:
Yum!!!
The quality of the food was very good.  This is more of a take out restaurant than a sit down.
They have coupons on the take out menus.. you can get something free ( egg rolls) for spending over $15..  but you need to ask for it.
I'm not a big fan of beef chinese dishes, but their Beef with broccoli is truly awesome! I liked it so much, that I had it 3 days in  row for lunch. Even better than going to the Chinese Cultural Center restaurants, more affordable and tastier! Lunch specials are affordable as are the dinner combos.
Anyways- so we get the cheaper prefix menu and it's only in Chinese, well, I start asking them what was on the one for $68 and what was on the one for $148.  After a little haggling back and forth about whether I can switch out certain dishes and get others instead ( really wished my mom was there cause she is a way better haggler) we decide to just stick with the $148 prefix menu.
Couple quick tips:
I'm never going to Panda again.
Service - 3/5
Growing up in NY,NY I know what authentic tastes like
- Tofu pudding is a great compliment, but it alone lacks taste. 
I guess my mistake was not ordering what I had ordered before such as their yummy shrimp dishes. 
This place serves tasty food, but I think some of the meals are overpriced.   My friend raved over her eggdrop soup, and my won ton soup was flavorful. I've been here twice and the entrees have been good. I have no complaints about service; the last time I went a mistake on our bill was quickly fixed with a smile by the server who made the error.  Although this isn't the first spot that will come to mind if I want to take friends out for Chinese food, it's someplace I would return to for my lunch break if I have a few extra dollars.
Growing up in Korea, I have early memories of eating Jjamppong, Jjajangmyun, & Mandu all the tme. It was a ubiquitous dish, not to mention cheap. Occassionally, my family had ordered it for delivery, the delivery man would carry the food in a big tin box with handles, on a motorcycle :P The noodles came in actual bowls, so after finish eating our delicious meal, we'd have to put the dirty dishes outside by the door(usually don't need to wash the bowls for them), so that the delivery man could come back for it later to pick up. I assume this is no longer the case in the State, haha :D 
Crispy fried salt and pepper shrimp -- OK, pretty standard
10 bucks (including tax and tip) for chicken, white rice, diet coke, and a headache.
Parking right out front. 
My wife got the sesame chicken, (tasty, but slippery, and with very little texture, not even slightly crispy), and side of lo mein, ($7.25 for a little box of noodles!!), and both were better than what I ordered. 
The price was high!- Is it they don't know how much other similar restaurants' similar food?!
Best Chinese food I've ever had. Orange chicken was delicious. Mongolian beef is great. Honey walnut shrimp is different but really tastily.
Love this place, try the salt & pepper pork..........
It's pretty standard Chinese food, but a nice, intimate atmosphere.
Awesome orange chicken, I got the white meat, it was amazingly crunchy, spring rolls were out of this world! what an incredible meal!!! thank you!
We had an order of spring rolls, I had katsu chicken, and my husband had general tso's chicken (this was on a separate summer menu).  The katsu chicken was very tasty, my only complaint is that the panko breading starts to get soggy as soon as they pour the sauce on top, so eat fast.  The general tso's, on the other hand, had a different breading that was perfectly crispy even after adding the sauce.  It was not at all spicy like the menu indicated, but were were perfectly fine with that.
We ordered an appetizer of fried shrimp and it was yummy, the shrimp and the fried coating was delicious.
I highly recommend Iron Chef for take out, but I would avoid for eating in.  We were starving when we stopped in and didn't want to wait the 20 mins to drive home.  The proprietors were very friendly and willing to customize your order to pretty much anything you like.
Thisn place is the TRUTH!!!! The most authentic tasting chinese that ive tasted in AZ.. THe orange chicken will change your life. They also have the best eggrolls Ive ever had and they are HUGE. Very affordable, the dinner combo is like $6.95.  Plus this place delivers.. THE BEST.
Decent food, great service, always good food.  Today, we had the pork with steam bun, sold by the 1/2 dozen, minute chicken with cake noodle, sweet and sour shrimp, and a stuffed tofu.  All were seasoned well, and as usually, the service was great.
Although it's not a particularly cheap Chinese, it's not massively more expensive than your average take-away. I felt that £15 was a reasonable price for a starter, main, rice and prawn crackers and I'm sure I'll be back again soon.
This was by far the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant in my entire life. I wish I could say I am exaggerating, but this really topped every bad experience I've ever had in the past. The entire experience was bad, from beginning to end. We came in for a Thanksgiving meal, and the hour we endured ruined the entire holiday.
I enjoy the Buffet both at lunch and dinner.  Inexpensive with great variety.  The menu provides cooked to order for many dished.  You may speak to the owner if your tastes require more upscale (yet affordable) fair.  An example would be the Orange Beef and the Pork Chow Mein in White Sauce is worth trying.  Take out is very convenient.  Portions are generous. 
For the most part, I've had OK experiences with the food selections. I don't expect spectacular food from this place, it is, after all, 'Fast Food' from a restaurant chain. It's nothing really special. 
Delicious
Great neighborhood place !
  This is my eighth Yelp check-in visit in China Garden. Friendly service and quality of the food has consistently been 4 stars.
We most recently visited on Christmas day for lunch with the family because NOBODY else was open and our major extended family gathering was set to be at supper time.  What were we to do for lunch.
Stay away from the familiar Americanized dishes and you will be rewarded.
Pros: Very stimulating and intricate interior design, delicious noodles, friendly service.
This used to be a favorite late-night spot for me. They have super cheap, and full-sized lunch and late-night specials. Some favorites being their battered and sweetened shrimp/prawns with pecans, or a good hot and sour soup. Shanghai style noodles are also a favorite. They're always quick and to the point. It's almost suspicious how quick they are.
I have tried the Nang Yang noodles.  Mmmm, Nang Yang noodles, yummy.  Huuuuge portion, could probably feed about 4-5 people.  It's chowfun noodles with peanut butter flavoring, beef, and some veggies.  This is very heavy, so a dish I highly suggest to share. 
Tried the lemon chicken and it was very good. Get the banana dessert with red bean ice cream!  Everyone working here is so nice. Can't wait to come back.
We had dinner there on Wednesday night around 9PM. The place was pretty empty. As soon we ordered, the chefs or cooks came out to eat their dinner and this waiter joined in with them. Needless to say, the food we ordered came to us one dish at a time, and the waiting time for each dish was about 5 minutes between. The food was OK, nothing fancy, service was not so good which is very typical of Chinese restaurant. Will we go again? Probably. There is just not too much choice of Chinese food around Las Vegas.
Veggie egg rolls $5.50 (flavor rating 2/5)
Hop in the car and try this place.  It's like taking a trip to Hong Kong without leaving the city, and you can even take that experience to go.  Happy travels!
This is definitely the best Chinese food in the area.  I'm happy they opened near us.  The General chicken is good and the ribs are good too.
My family used to have property in LV and whenever we would be in town we would frequent this place a lot. You would expect to that this place would be in Chinatown but its actually off of Spring Mountain and closer to auto-row. And it's next to a Subway so you can't really miss it. 
"You are an artistic person - let your colors show."
It was not a cheap meal, but he commented ten years ago in Vegas, food was cheap cause they wanted you to spend elsewhere.  That's not true anymore.  Most everything we ate anywhere that week was overpriced and sub-par.  At least we felt totally justified in what we spent for this meal.  We left for our nights adventure full and very happy!
Good take out. Limited wine selection. Decent Chinese for Anthem. Then again there isn't much to choose from.  Very friendly people and my food is almost always correct for take out.
Happy... Watching the guy making hand-pulled noodles in the kitchen... Sad... Wish we'd ordered more variety to see how he does each...
This is our go-to Asian restaurant in Las Vegas.  I've been here many times, but only one dish really stands out to me: pepper and salt shrimp.  They do a really nice job getting a nice crispiness on the shrimp and flavor it well.  I could eat that stuff all day.
2. really fast. seriously i stopped in and gave them my order and it was ready in less than 15 minutes.
Save your health neighbors..go to the Volcano Grill.  Fresh meat, and vegetables grilled without breading, without heavy sauces.  A variety of fresh made sauces.(yum yum sauce!!) a much better, tastier, healthier option.
Fresh hand made noodles made right in front of you.  The portions are good this is a casual dining place. I came here for the duck noodle soup and my hubby ordered the beef chow fun.
So, if you want belly filling Chinese and are desperate, than go for it.
Who ever rated more than 1 start doesn't know real Chinese food! I regret spending a penny there. And also the staff and service are terrible how do these people even gave a job.
I highly recommend both options.
I went to dinner here last night and the food was cold and tasted like it had been sitting for hours. They didn't have a very big selection and I was not impressed.
I stopped to get a quick bite to eat and wasn't disappointed. Beef chow mein is delcious,  it's not the bland stuff you'll find at similar joints.  Orange chicken is also A grade.  Service was quick to us and quick to deliver.
I took the day off from work today to get some errands done and at around 1:30 pm I found myself at Sprouts which is in the same strip mall as Wahsun, so I thought I'd give it a go...again. And I was once again let down. At lunchtime, on a Thursday, Wahsun was closed. At least this time there was a large CLOSED sign on the front window.
Spent time visiting an artist friends studio in Tempe on Saturday. We decided to get a bite to eat and drove to Wong's Place.  I've been here 6 or 7 times in the last 2 years and have always had a good meal.  I had the kung pao chicken lunch special for $5.95, which included a decent hot and sour soup, fried rice, crab puffs and hot green tea.  The service was attentive and I never went without an ice cold glass of water.  The chicken was spiced well and was tasty, not too spice, just right for me.
-Nasty empty fish tank water. 
The BBQ Rib started was so microwaved hot you couldn't hold it. By the time you could it was rock hard and dried out.
Ok, here is my final review.  The best dish that we ordered was the sweet potato fries.  The other main course dishes were not up to par.
5th time and i've been here and its the 5th time they get everything right!!! prices are great. the food is gourmet tasting and the service is on the spot!!!
I used to live in Sacramento and would come home to visit family in Tempe.  At the time this was the only "chinese" restaurant (1990's).  My family would drag me here and I would be aghast at the small portions and steep prices (chow mein for $8-10?) and the portions were about 2/3rds the size of what I would get for $6.  Ignorance is bliss and when there's no competition, they can do this kind of stuff.
the smell was off
This was a Saturday evening they delivered within 20 min , (we were about. 1 mile away ) but still for a Saturday that was very good.
I just can't get enough of the appetizers...but do be kind...if they're busy at lunch, don't order them - because I learned today it takes 8 minutes to do one order of the lacey dumplings alone...  and because all their food is from scratch - she hates disappointing folks - and backing up the kitchen.  I can understand that - and respect her - and I want their business to be booming - just not when I'm there so I can drown myself in their dumpling deliciousness.  I'd die happy.
I don't know if or when I will be back to Chop Chop Wok.  I do like there food more often than not but after what I saw while waiting 20+ minutes for take out, I'm not sure how they have an "A" rating.  I may give it some time and check them out at a later date.  I need to see if they drop a letter or two.  I do sincerely hope they clean up their act and restaurant soon.
Anyways, ordered the mongolian beef for the BF and seschwan chicken for me.  Served with corn soup and fried noodles.  All the food was good.
Food : GREAT!!!!
I hope that hot pot Chinese catches on more in the states. Yum!
For Americanized Chinese fast food, the bear has nothing on China One.(At least at this location, anyway) everything is made to order, hot off the wok, and the service is very quick, efficient, and they always check up on you if you needed a thousand more grains of rice, to make sure your meal is what you expected, or even refill your drink for you.
When friends are in town, and time is short, Sui Wok is my go-to place.
An asian food court is supposed to open at Palazzo off the casino floor eventually, so it's nice to know there are potentially better options coming soon.
April 14th 2010
If we lived in the area we would definitely become regulars.  We had two lunch menu dishes plus two fruit smoothies and our bill before tip was under $21, so great price for the experience.  Thanks to all the local yelpers who reviewed this place so we could learn about it!!!!
The location given on Yelp is not exactly the most accurate, so took us a good 10 min to drive around the block to try to spot it. It's tucked at the back of a corner of the intersection, with one side having a really sketchy sign.
I'd only go back for the dessert and drinks!
Jasmine tea here is the bomb. They probably grab this from heaven. Best jasmine tea I've tasted now that I think about it. 
They have pad thai on the menu which was interesting. This neighborhood could sure use a purely Thai cuisine restaurant instead. If they are going to mix up the types of Asian foods there, you might as well throw in some. Korean or Vietnamese while your at it and make everyone happy since you can't find these foods in Fountain hills.
But seriously - such a  small price to pay for excellent Chinese!!
      Intense rich fresh pork & green onion flavor. 
I have been going to this restaurant since it opened about 5 years ago (I think).  I love noodles, and this place has really good noodles!  I usually get the singapore noodles with tofu and shrimp.  This is my favorite place when ordering tofu.
The service was good, especially considering how packed the lounge area was with others partaking in the happy hour.
I've come here once before 2 years ago and it was mediocre... but i came back to give it another chance.
Favorites include Spider Prawn Dumplings, Dim Sum platter, DUngeness Crab and Sweet corn soup, and many of the beef dishes. 
First of all that was way too much food for one person and it easily stretched into 5 meals: the noodles are more than enough for two dinners and the pork with the rice can make 3 lunches. Next time I'll add an order of some kind of stir fried greens and make a more balanced series of meals ;)
The walnut shrimp is the best I've had in Phoenix, but didn't compare to the other entrees. 
Bad sushi, do not try the coconut nigori, it's not that good. Everything is overpriced for the poor quality fish. Avoid this place, or just order the Kung Pao Chicken. You can never go wrong with that. But at this price, you'd be better off at Panda Express.
I really like the food here. The black pepper chicken is super good and has a little spice to it which I love.  The drinks are good. The atmosphere is fun. It's a little pricey, but it's Scottsdale. :) I liked that the sauces weren't too slimy, if you know what I mean! One thing we ordered wasn't too good, I wouldn't get it again- was the wonton soup. It was totally flavorless. Other than that, everything was great.
Just no. Never again. I would rather eat paper towels than return to this wretched place.
Going to play it safe and go with a A-OK rating for this place. Maybe I just like the authentic versions more than the typical Americanized stuff. But don't be surprised if you see me here again when we are working in the area. ORDER UP!
I MISS YOU SHANGHAI!  COME BACK
The first time I ordered takeaway food here it was not ready when I arrived.  I arrived 5 minutes after it was supposed to be ready and ended up waiting for 50 minutes longer.  The food took 70 minutes rather than the 15 they quoted on the phone.
Onto the dinner menu: excellent! 
I knew I was in a NY style Chinese place as soon as I saw the huge poster-sized paper menus. It seems like every Chinese place I ever ate at as a kid before moving to Arizona had that exact menu. I knew right then that I would like this place.
The best place for seafoods and everything else. We've tried many places and we cleared the table. It's Mother's Day so it's busy at all the places we normally go to, so this was the place by chance. I've never liked all the dishes we order in one sitting like here. I think we ordered 11 dishes. So happy. I'll be back.
ya know.... NOT BAD.  did have a pre-determined thought about China Grill.... Thought... oh great.... another chinese place... have been burned before... many times before... however, determined to find a decent chinese place... so  let's try.........  The staff was great!  Food was Good!  we will be back!
A restaurant is just as much about service as it is about food. Service was fast and friendly. So all in all, 5 stars.
Great family owned restaurant that really cares about their customers. They remember their regulars by name and ask about your family members or friends.
The only thing we didn't like so far was the Duck tongue in xo sauce. The bone inside made it really awkward to eat.
   Making my way past clean but empty tables and booths to the counter, I was almost greeted by the woman seated there who was shelling and munching what looked like black beans while watching Chinese soaps online. It used to be just a radio; isn't tech grand? Except, of course, when it coughs up 70 MILLION sets of personal information to hackers.
The main dining room isn't especially big, but has several booths and table to sit at. 
Please note that you can see the kitchen staff.   They too seem uninspired which is probably reflective of the food.
I had a beer and hot sake for the low price of $3.99.  My dinner with the food, alcohol, tax and tip was $16.  Not cheap but not that bad either.
- interesting menu with lots of choices
The strange thing about this place was the bathrooms. Why I pay close attention to bathrooms in places I'll never know. But this place had the stalls set up like separate pods, alien like. And they're individual stalls with TVs playing music videos, etc. It was very oddly set up. None the less it was very nice, but just very odd.
The delivery man was very cordial, however, the food was the worst Chinese I've ever had (Order: Crab Rangoon, Chicken Fried Rice, Pork Egg Roll, General Tso's Chicken) - the chicken and rice was dry, the general tso's was mostly fried dough, the crab rangoon had overpowering green onions and the fortune cookie stale.
It's hard to find good Chinese in this area.
Lastly, I normally finish the meal with a Boba milk tea (delicious).
So basically, Must Love Fish if you're gonna get the noodle dishes here. 4 stars in that case. If you want your pork to just be pork, then see rating above.
My expectations of chinese delivery places in Gilbert or Mesa are pretty low, but this place is SOO much better than anything we've ordered in the area before.
Roasted Pineapple and Vanilla Bean Parfait
One of Mr. M's coworkers was raving about the egg rolls from this place, so one afternoon after visiting the Halloween stores in the area we decided to stop in and try 'em out.  We also got an order of their salt and pepper calamari.  As soon as we walked in we were greeted by a friendly gentleman who asked us if this was our first visit.  He took our to-go order and then offered and brought us some water while we waited.  The egg rolls were very good and fresh and not greasy at all.  The calamari was exceptional with light tempura-style breading that was fresh, crispy, and also not greasy.  The peppers and onions provided a great grilled flavor and made us wish we had a couple of cold beers in hand to have with our very tasty appetizers. 
We started with drinks. I got their special mojito made with dragon fruit. It was delicious, and had this piece of caramelized dragon fruit as garnish. YUM! My friend liked her blood orange margarita too. 
For inexpensive, cooked to order Chinese food, this is the place. I have been eating from here since 1988 and their food has always been consistently good. I usually get the beef & broccoli but I though I would try something different and got the beef with vegetables. It was good. The beef was plentiful, tasty and cooked to perfection. The veggies were piled high. All hot, crispy and fresh. Everything was served on a bed of white rice and the soda is all you can drink. 
if you are forever alone have a seat at the bar by the kitchen wall.
this restaurant is small, not fancy, and good quality. they have a separate bar with cheap drinks. the food is very good. they give you a ton of food and the prices are cheaper then other places. i can't eat rice due to medical reasons, and this is the only place i know of that i can order a large meal at a chinese restaurant and there's no rice automatcially mixed into it. my particular meal is a large meal of vegetables and different meats. only $8. it's enough for 2 people. all the meals come with rice but its served on it's own plate, so if you're not a rice lover, it's really a good way to go. the service is good and it's a super extensive menu. good all around place.
Service was slow and they didn't seem to care about your requests.
When you are in a location like they have you have to do something compelling to bring people to your restaurant.  Value priced food, exceptional service, or fresh ingredients.  But Golden Wok just wants to be another bad Chinese place. Just like 10,000 other places in strip malls in the valley.
by the way .. we got fortune cookies..
This is the kind of Chinese restaurant you would expect to find in Chinatown. Good, authentic Chinese cuisine for an excellent price.
The first time I had their green beans they were savory, tender and sweet. Now they are bland at best and maybe even a little on the raw side. Their sweet and sour chicken is literally mush. Do not recommed..
This place brings back great memories. Of youth, fun and friends. A few weeks ago, I decided I wanted to eat here again. I had not done so in years (more then 5, less then 10). I took a new friend and ordered my old favorite, House Special Chicken. It was just as I remembered it. Crispy fried outside, sitting in a ginger and garlic sauce (I love it when food in a sauce is still crisp). My friend approved of her Sesame Chicken but I didn't try any of it, myself. 
Honey Garlic Chicken
I have to say hands down that this is the best chinese food I have had to date! We have ordered delivery a couple times here (a total of 4 different dishes and 2 appetizers) and the food was fresh and very flavorful.
I didn't think it was very good. We got the chicken fried rice, paper wrapped chicken, shrimp pad thai & sesame chicken - none of which was really good. The fried rice was horrible. I don't know why this place is so busy.
I have eaten at Red 8 two times now-on two different visits to LV. I have had great luck so far. Great food, not too expensive (most LV prices are $$$) and really good service. I went there with my boyfriend both times and we both really had a wonderful time. The ambiance is cool and the staff is friendly. Also, the food is pretty fast. We had different things each time and still had great luck. This last trip I had the Pad Thai and he had the Kung Pow Chicken-both really great. If you are planning to go to Le Reve at the Wynn, eat at Red 8 first. Grea food and close to the theater. It's a Win Wynn-hehe! 
The best me and my wife have had in Vegas. The trick here is order the full order and tell them how you want it. We had the pork fried rice extra dark lots of soy and hot 
I don't normally expect good service from a chinese retaurant unless you're at a chained restaurant like P.F. Chang's. But this place is the worst both food and service. The younger gentleman with glasses at the counter is really rude. I was recommended to this place by a friend who said it's the best Chinese go to for him since he always do a take out order. Recently a young gentleman at the register screwed up his order as well. 
I am new to the state of Arizona and had a mad craving for some good ole' Chinese Food that was not part of a 2 or 3 item combo with rice and noodles. I took my chances and stopped into this place. The lunch menu was reasonable around $5 - $7. However, I asked for shrimp egg fu yung which was not on the menu but available. I ordered it a la carte with shrimp fried rice. It was delicious. I will definitely stop by again. I am not sure of the other menu items but this was an excellent choice for me.
My sesame chicken tasted like every other order of sesame chicken I've ever had.  I was not a fan of the fried rice that accompanied it.  It tasted kind of like I would expect feet to taste.  My boyfriend had chicken chow mein and orange chicken with the sauce on the side, and he was a fan of both.  Service was accurate and prompt, although, I asked for "lots" of sweet and sour sauce, and they gave me one small container of it, no more than they normally give.
Food was delicious. Will definitely go back next time I am at the MGM. Hot and Sour soup is a must. Bit pricey for lunch but that also could be due to the fact that we ordered a ton of items. Duck was outstanding!
Overall, I won't go back here, as there are too many other more appealing places.
Wow, I am so glad I decided to try this place. Inside, the restaurant is spotless and nicely decorated. Very nice. I got takeout, and the food was amazing. As a vegan, it's tough to find tofu dishes anywhere in the West Valley. I highly recommend the kung pao tofu dish with a side of vegetable noodles.
What keeps us coming back? Well, the portions are a good size, and sometimes it's just so damn good. Also, it's never overly greasy, it's so convenient, and the lady who always takes our orders and is there when we pick-up is just so sweet. 
Pong Pongs has been here forever. The food is cheap chinese food but usually has really good flavor. They have all the standard dishes.  
The eggrolls, pot stickers were good.  Pot stickers are actually quite stuffed.
Still, shouldn't every Mom n' Pop restaurant in your neighborhood be like that? 
I ate here on my birthday when we did a group trip to Vegas. We got in late, and didn't know where to go and ended up choosing this because the baby they use to advertise was everywhere in the hotel.
* This place is a little hard to find, but look for Sonny's Saloon.  Diamond Chinese is connected.
I still haven't found my "go-to" Chinese food place in Phoenix, but this place is pretty solid.
Mussels
I highly reccommend if you are wanting to try a new place, go here and get the Mogolian Beef.
It is said to be authentic Shanghai style cuisine and some dishes are. Their Wonton is very good.
The good- We were escorted into the nightclub. Though it was strange that at our table they asked if we were on a guest list. We were, but I figured they would have waived our cover regardless. We were each given a voucher for a free cocktail inside the club.
I love this place... but if I ever had to pay myself I would skip it.
The steamed potstickers with shrimp are super yummy. The mongolian beef is good, but a little greasy (especially if you heat it up the next day), Their fried rice is tasty and whether I've eaten in or gotten take-out, the service has been really good and the food consistent in looks and flavor.
The decor of this place is just so cute. It has the asian feel yet very modern so I def. like it. The food here was pretty good overall but not very good dim sum.
they got our order wrong, it took forever, and it was completely flavorless...  I had a few bites and lost my appetite. 
Have been to Flo's for over 7 years, the food is fresh, the service
What hubby objected to was paying premium prices for average or below average tasting food.  I noted that because of Scottsdale rents and having a nice decor and tablecloths, etc the prices are higher.  His attitude is that he doesn't eat decor or tablecloths, he eats food... and you know, he is right. We paid close to $50 for two people without drinks for mediocre Chinese food.  I must take a lesson from hubby,  eat the food, not the decor.   The food DEFINITELY needs improvement so I don't understand what the fascination is with this restaurant. Perhaps the pickings are slim in Scottsdale........
Only good dish is Singapore noodle.
I've eaten here several times.  The food is ok.  I've always felt like the dumplings weren't quite a full meal; I'd really like if there were side options with them.  I would rate them a three except for the pricing.  Yesterday, my boyfriend and I went to get a small dinner and paid $21 despite not ordering beverages (they have free water).
It had the traditinal round table and lazy susan so everyone can share meals. I enjoyed EVERYTHING and I was so happy that the Shrimp was the big juicy kind and there were plenty of them! I hate when you go to restaraunts and get  those little shrimp that looked like they were the last  few in the bag that  they bought at safeway!
Nice clean place!
My wife likes it so I get it for her cause I love her.
Eyeball Tacos in LA? Camel in Cairo? Guinea pig in Lima? No problem. The food at Shaanxi will not be readily accessible for some, but you will never discover new dishes/cuisines if you don't make an effort.
Okay, so I understand this place isn't going compare to any of he excellent Northern Chinese restaurants in the San Gabriel Valley. But, I was hopeful after speaking to the staff, many of which were from China. They described the food as being excellent.
They are located in the Pizza Hut complex off broadway west of mill ave
If you are looking for a lot of options and good food...then you will not be disappointed
I got one of the chow mein dishes w/ the noodles done Hong Kong style, fried.  The dish itself was fine, but the noodles were weird.  Part of them looked like they had not been put in oil and fried adequately...they were dried and stiff.  I pulled that bit out onto my extra plate.  
When we walked in the hostess/owner was very nice. The decor a little dumpy and the lighting bright so far from romantic or cozy. 
Not bad, but not good either. I requested a lunch portion of the Orange Chicken, it is not on the menu so it is a dollar more. I did not get anything like I would consider orange chicken. It was okay tasting and a little on the cold side. I will not be back. Guess I should have known when it was empty at lunch time.
It wasn't all bad, there was a crispy chicken with garlic dish that was pretty good, but out of 10 dishes 4 were bad, 5 were okay, and 1 was good.  
The XLB is still my favorite must order item.
Bottom line
Tip: DON'T GO.
Good sesame chicken, orange chicken, beef and broccoli.
PS:  On my last visit, my fortune cookie read "Learn Chinese".  Rosetta Stone here I come.
Kwelin's food was good, I wouldn't say the best I have had but we both thoroughly enjoyed it.  The staff were friendly and even though we were blatantly stopping them going home they never made us feel like we had to leave.  I found it good value and would definitely go again.
China Wok...You're like a good friend I can always count on! I get delivery from here usually once a week, or whenever I'm feeling down in the dumps. Yes, the food isn't amazing or super authentic, but it's really tasty. And affordable. AND- what's really important- the food is always piping hot when it's delivered! I usually get the broccoli beef, house spicy chicken or sesame chicken, and either the hot and sour soup or egg drop. It's all good!
4.5 out of 5
The food was good overall and spicy enough for me (which is rare). The portion size was generous. The only issue I had (and its a big one) is that the quality of chicken was poor at best. The pieces were small, not very tasty and a few of them were gristly which tends to be an appetite suppressant. Not the best Chinese in the Area.
I ordered take out, so this review won't include customer service, etc. My coworker and I ordered orange chicken, fried rice, egg drop soup and crab puffs. Every single thing was completely disappointing. The orange chicken had a thick marmalade texture and did not taste very good. The fried rice was just what the name is--fried rice. There weren't onions, scrambled eggs, peas or carrots. I would have been better off ordering white rice; pretty much the same thing. The egg drop soup was not very good either. And the crab puffs hardly had any filling. I was really craving Chinese food at the time and I was so disappointed when I took those first bites. I won't be trying this place again.
To follow, we ordered a medium egg drop soup. It was humungous! The fish bowl sized serving could have easily served four. It was also quite delicious. Good and eggy, without being goopy.
- needs better decorating touch
Some fresh crunchy veggies added to the common fare made our dishes more enjoyable.  Fast takeout!
With only a 30 min lunch window, I have to make use of the time I have.  Great Wall is fast and efficient.  
LH's review (2012) is spot on!   This is American Chinese food in a nice atmosphere and friendly service.   The portions are generous and prices reasonable (cheap compared to other places).  You feel like you are in a Chinese American  restaurant. 
It pains me to write this review.  I have been a weekly patron of this establishment for years as my office is only half a mile away.  Last November we celebrated my birthday and the office asked me where I wanted to order from, I chose Mr Wong.  Our order came to over $100 and they forgot one order of lemon chicken.  Not only would they not deliver the order they forgot, they made my co-worker pay AGAIN for her entree (we had given ask the money plus tip to the driver who brought us our original order).  When I got wind of this, I was furious and quite frankly, embarrassed as this restaurant was my suggestion.  I drove to Mr Wong figuring that seeing me (a regular) maybe they would make things right.....nope!  The witch behind the counter refused.  
The first choice (best rating, closest to me) said they didn't deliver to my address.  My second choice made a new (to me) use of the Internet.  Found the place with Yelp, but when I went to place an order I got handed off to a site called Eat24.  What they did was take the order, with pull down menus for all the options (like, what kind of rice would you like?) and took the credit card information (and presumably validated it) and then passed the order on to the restaurant.
Today (11:30 lunch) the carts came around often, and everything except the pork buns was piping hot and fresh. By the way, despite the price increases, even the sticky rice was considered a medium size entree, and the two of us eating there escaped with a bill under $20 and we were done in under 30 minutes.
First time customer... I had their Kung Pao Chicken delivered with some rice sides and I was not disappointed they were so friendly and food was delivered very quickly... The food was amazing super fresh and hot.. new favorite delivery
Comped meal would have cost over $300, but don't think I will be going back for the yumilicious tea.
The plates and cups they brought out were visibly dirty. I don't even know how a cup that would only be used for tea could get so dirty. There was also still a significant amount of dishwater left in my cup when I got it. Busy or not, there is no excuse to have dishes brought out like that.
Our server was completely disinterested in giving us any kind of service, and simply rushed us at our table.  I had to ask for everything... noodles for our soup (a small amount was offered to me for which they charged me), hot mustard, water, everything.   
Some reviewers have said, that the restaurant plays loose and easy with their hours and this is true.  They're supposed to be open till 8pm  (ahh, the joys of late night dining in a "major" city); but sometimes they'll stay open later ... sometimes not.  Be flexible!  I know, it's frustrating; but the food is worth it.  Come here and you'll never eat Chop Suey or Fried Rice ever again!
I usually get the Tom Yam Soup with Shrimp - Very good
 I still wanted to speak to a manger. The manager came out and said the server forgot to put the order in. Well fine that happens however there should have been a rush once I brought it up to the hostess and the server should have came over to let us know what was going on. She took that off our check and offered dessert. However for dropping the ball as much as they did that was more of a slap in the face.  Our beverages were empty for over 15 mins and my food was cold as I waited for my friends to come out.  My 2 other guest I told them to eat as this dinner was for them. 
Secondly the remodel is Beautiful ..... However, why wasn't the Rock Concert noise level remedied ?????
The broth in the #26 was good but I have had better (Hu Tieu in OC, on Newhope), and the wontons in my dad's noodles were a disaster. The meat in it had a smell that indicated that it is old and pretty much going bad. My seafood udon was not very spicy and not very flavorful. There was not a lot of noodles in it either. I also got the assorted vegetable chow fun. It was seriously lacking in flavor and very greasy. I ended up tossing most of it. Overall, I would not come back for any of the noodles here. This place still has a long way to go to even think about competing with the SGV noodle scene
The boneless chicken with vegetables was nice because there were different kind of veggies. I found the deep fried pork chops a bit on the salty side. Overall I thought the food was just average. Portions were small which was a bit disappointing. The sizes were not what I would think would be served for a dinner. It was small and not something I would expect for family style Chinese.
I will gladly go here then the strip for better noodles, great broth/sauce, great service and a lower price for these better options.  I hope they will revisit the noodle show option I would love to see it and I am sure many more people would schedule a visit accordingly if they set a time for one once a night or so.
For our first night in Vegas we chose to stay in our own hotel and have a nice meal.  We were on our honeymoon!  
I have been going to Tams every since I was a little girl in church. Now that I am an adult I still go and I enjoy the food. The prices are great, I usually order fried chicken (garlic or jalapeno), egg fu yung, and shrimp fried rice. I get all of these items for around 20 dollars. I love this place, and I will continue to go back along as it remains. I will introduce my children to the goodness of Tams just like my parents did for me! (:
I FINALLY had a chance to try this place out after hunting for delivery Chinese food all day on Sunday without any success -- typical Phoenix -- the one place my gf and I found was actually CLOSED on Sundays.  Weak.
Funny, we decided to go back to the West Charleston location for the first time in a year because we happened to have some business to attend to in the vicinity. Mistake. Going back to the 921 S. Rainbow location and never looking back! The South Rainbow store has maintained the quality of ingredients that the China One brand is known for.
Normally I don't care for anything called "Other state + food type" I want Chinese Chinese food!
Boiled Wantons
This is a pretty good, CHEAP, Chinese joint down by the UNLV campus that is actually worth taking a visit to.
Very friendly owners (family owned), very small place, great food! Try the beef Mongolian and creamcheese rangoons. They are amaze balls. Place is hidden, location could be better. But if you have a problem with that then Gary opened another location off 90th St. and Via Linda in Scottsdale.
My wife and I were craving Chinese takeout, since we can't get any at home. We checked out a lot of places near the Strip and found most of them either way too authentic or way too upscale/stylized/Asian (think PF Chang's). 
After moving here from the S.F bay area I had a hard core Chinese food craving but was trying find something close to home. The food was good. A bit crowded. Best for take out.  Mongolia beef was awesome. Chicken wings are yummy. Quality and service was a pleasant surprise.
Garlic Spinach - Do NOT expect American spinach. This tastes totally different, and totally mouthwatering
First thing we ordered was the hot and sour soup. A steal at $3.50 for a small portion, which was enough to feed 3-4. Unfortunately, it was neither hot (spicy) nor sour. It wasn't bad, but it definitely didn't live up to its name.
Friendly staff and owners great place for lunch and dinn staff and owners great place for lunch and dinner.
I could not agree more with Adam C's review. The only cool thing about this place is that it doubles as a chinese-restaurant AND a saloon. There's a little corridor between the two.
Love that I can make the Mongolian Beef to my spice level and the Fried Rice is great.
Ordered the vegetable noodles and substituted the boiled egg for a fried one (how I like to eat it). Noodles were delicious and fresh. Only downside is that "vegetable" meant a little bit of spinach and some cilantro. 
What stood out for us was the Sommelier, Sarah.  She was attentive, friendly, and paired an amazing Pinot Noir from Martinelli that went perfectly with the duck.  We quizzed her a bit and she really knows her stuff.  Thanks Sarah!  I will be back!
Had a large group dinner at China Grill after a party at Red Square.  It was an expense account evening, so extravagance was the order of the day.  There were eight of us and we ate A LOT.
I love this place.  There is nothing I have tried there that was not a solid, well made dish.  Good sushi, good soup, good appetizers,  good everything.  I cannot think of a single dish that really stands out, but every single item I've tried is fresh, exactly the right temperature, large portioned, and seasoned exactly the way it's supposed to be.  The prices are very good also.  I go to Li's often and will keep going for a long time!
My favorite dish that I've tried here is the Stir Fried Udon with Seafood.  They also offer an XO sauce, which adds some spicy heat that I have yet to try.  Their Shanghai Dumplings are pretty good, but I've def had better.  I thought their House Chow Fun and Beef Short Ribs were just ok.  
Yummy & cheap.  You get lots for your dollar.  I run in for take-out now and then, or get delivery a couple miles away.  Sometimes i walk in with my youngest kid, 3 years old, and they got a little toy cart he can push around.  When he tries to head back into the kitchen, they chuckle at him.  I can attest to fine egg rolls, Mongolian Beef, yui-shan spicy pork, orange chicken (spicy!), moo shu pork.  Since we moved to Chandler 13 months ago, i have not bothered to try another go-to Chinese place.  Now I am frakking hungry
We were a group of four people and we were seated right away on a late Saturday night....
======================================
The food was pretty good ... and I'm Chinese.  So I've had all sorts of Chinese food.  From cheap to ridiculously expensive.  From street vendor to exclusive VIP.  I really enjoyed it.   You can tell that an actual Chinese person prepared the meal and menu versus PF Chang's where it's Caucasian owned and run.  
This place is the best, I have been coming here all my life. Their orange chicken is awesome. Come in for lunch and you will get an awesome deal but dinner is not pricey. I still drive from Arcadia for their food if i am really in the mood for great Chinese food.
the pot of tea was piping hot but especially delicious. the wonton chips were a good start. we went with the moo shoo pork and kung pao chicken, both pretty good. the crepes that the moo shoo pork came in were so soft and fluffy and the meat and seasonings were spot on. the kung pao chicken was a little water and not as spicy as i thought it was going to be. but it had peanuts, bamboo shoots, and my favorite chinese vegetable, water chestnuts...mmmm. the big bowl of rice we got was delicious as well.
Not that I didn't enjoy the food, it just wasn't so spectacular that I want to hit this place up every visit to Las Vegas. It surely beats fast food and it's close to family and inexpensive so it's on a list of places I'll consider but not crave. 
I order their lunch specials quite often, which are very cheap (around 5-6 bucks), and give you a lot of food. 
BTW, the service is here always really friendly and quick.  Big smile for that!
curries - they're all good. And a bunch of
My favorites are the pan fried rice cake, seafood/port with rice noodle soup, stir-fry needle noodle with shrimp/xo sauce, and roast duck with egg noodles, Their service is excellent and it gets quite busy during dinner time! I would definitely come back again and again.
I probably will not be going here again. Just doesn't seem worth it when you have so many choices in Las Vegas.
3. Raddish, Beef, and Tendon in sauce in clay pot
Watch noodles being pulled while you wait! lol 
When a waitress came back we asked her to translate the one Chinese Menu that was by our table. We decided to order from that menu. After that they were very nice to us and very helpful. She told us for future visits to just tell her what we like and she will suggest plates to us.
Thank you -  (Xièxiè) - China Chili, David and Lisa, for a memorable meal!  I look forward to returning soon to try some of my other Chinese favorites!
Me and my family comes here for great food, and that's what you'll get when you come to HK Star! It would've been a 5 star if it was the food alone. This place lacks atmosphere, and there is no signs of customer service anywhere. The servers are rude, the chefs will occasionally get your orders wrong, and the manager won't even greet you at the door, whether he's there or not. I like the food here, but I'm going to eat here less often because the servers suck at service. At least they should give you water and refills without you having to ask them.
Ate here before a show at the Mirage....the atmosphere is very modern, but a little too close to the casino and you can hear it in the background. Had a very nice table in the corner with cushions. Peking duck was prepared perfectly and was carved right at our table, but nothing else was remarkable.
--------------------------------------
Other than that, they have good chinese food if you want it quick but good quality. The fact that it is cooked fresh in front of you once you order it is a good thing, nothing like panda express where they have their food sitting out in the open under the heat. What's also important is that the staff keeps the place clean.
A delightful and elegant Chinese restaurant located adjacent to the lagoon in front of the Bellagio.  Having been to China, I can attest to the authenticity of the decor.  The restaurant also features floor-to-ceiling windows, offering an unmatched view of the fountains.  The service was extremely attentive but unintrusive, as I've come to expect from the Bellagio.  Now, for the food.  We ordered a wide array of dishes, as there were 10 of us.  The lemon chicken stood out more than anything else, as did the sweet and sour pork.  Both were among the best I've ever had, artistically presented, and not at all heavy (none of the food was greasy or heavy, which Americanized Chinese cuisine generally is).  Some other highlights were the Mongolian beef (spicy and tender), and the Crème Brulee, which was presented in one of the most creative ways I've ever seen.  If you're going to have one nice meal in Vegas, I'd skip Jasmine, because you can find delicious and authentic Chinese food in most major cities, but if you're a diehard fan of this cuisine and want an elegant alternative to more traditional fare, give Jasmine a try.
Good and reasonable Si Chuan cuisine not to far from the strip.  I had a delicious cucumber in garlic appetizer (shared with my dining companion) and the fish hotpot for the main course.  The fish hotpot was of a generous size (probably enough for two but the food was very light and I was hungry, so I ate a good portion of it) and only cost 13.99.  It was somewhat spicy (not particularly compared to Si Chuan restuarants I've visited in China) and very flavorful, and everything tasted very fresh.  The place is not much to look at, but the service was better than I'd read, quite pleasant actually.  I'd recommend wholeheartedly.
I just moved to Scottsdale last Friday and for some reason on my first night in town I just had a craving for Chinese food.  My husband had been living here since April, so he had been to Flo's a couple of times, so he suggested we go there.
With a maximum capacity of 30, there are a few booths that can accommodate parties of four, a few small tables for two, and one larger table for the bigger group.  I suggest calling for reservations if they take it because there was a bit of wait while we were dining.
The ordering process was easy. Then came the long wait. And I mean LONG. You would think something with a name like minute chicken wouldn't take very long. But it was almost half an hour before I got my order. There wasn't a place for you to wait for a take-out order, so I basically stood on the side near the restrooms pretty much staring at the blown up articles they had on the walls. 
My wife and I went when it was the old owners, it was terrible.  We waited forever and the food never came before we walked out.  People were served before us that walked in after and my wife actually got her soup before me and I sat and waited while they "made more".
Well what can I say about Panda? If you discount the greasiness of the food and the lack of authenticity of the "Chinese" it is trying to replicate, you get a very very good fast food meal. That being said it all depends on whether you are in the mood for fast food (thus expect grease) and/or authentic Chinese food.
IMHO, their decor rocks! I love the cheesy waterfall in the front, the chairs with coffee cup designs and giant turntable-centered family-sized tables. The green walls are an upgrade from the pink and blue that was there before. Go to Fate if you want to sit in faux-modern Ikea surroundings.
If you are thinking of eating here, think twice! Go to the new location at Via Linda and 90th street. I haven't been there yet, but it HAS to be better than this original location!
As soon as you walk in, one can tell this looks like a restaurant that serves an  AUTHENTIC Chinese foods.
Ordered delivery from here, and it was surprisingly good although not the fastest delivery (Friday night). The lo mein was tasty and my sizzling rice chicken was very flavorful, although more sweet than I would have expected. Actually tasted better the second day, too.
Big bummer since we live nearby. The food is pretty good, BUT, it was lukewarm. I really wanted to microwave it. We had 6 entrees, so maybe that was part of it? The orange chicken was tasty but barely any spice (and it had an asterisk warning). I was  so glad that the chicken was well cut so it didn't have any fatty parts or grossness. Staff is friendly, place is clean. I'll try the food again.
Super friendly service. My girlfriend and I went here after the Cardinals game. I ordered the hot and sour soup which was great and general chicken. I didn't really care for the suace on the general chicken but that is just me. I would definatley go back and try another dish. Its much more inviting on the inside then it looks.
I can't even give this place a single star but yelp makes me to write a review. New ownership has been a downgrade.  Last time food was cold, this time the wrong food which I sent back. My waiter later asks me if I wanted something new after my boyfriend was done. I talk to manager and she tells me I'm the only one that complained about the waiter and they are making changes to become a sports bar to bring in customers. Can't bring in new customers with bad food and poor service and bad attitudes. Won't be back.
I was on my way home and placed a call in order for delivery, using my credit card to pay.  Since the boyfriend was home to receive the order, this seemed like a wonderfully convenient idea, which I would later learn otherwise.  The delivery driver arrives and informs boyfriend, "No card, no food."  They failed to advise of this little detail that the credit card and ID must be present and offered for review at the time and location of delivery, otherwise they will give you the food.  The delivery driver took the food back to the restaurant and informed boyfriend that I would have to drive there to pick up my delivery order and show them my credit card before they would release the order.  So, I go pick up my delivery order and ask for a refund of the delivery fee.  At this time they inform me that my card was already charged at the time of the order, also at the same time they could have informed about their policy that they won't deliver the food if the card isn't on location.  They couldn't figure out how to refund the delivery fee, so in my frustration I told them not to worry about it, as I decided that we would rather eat our food while it's still luke warm, rather than completely cold.
Usually I patronize greasy spoon take-out Chinese places with smeared windows, but it was a real treat to find Dragon Wok.  It feels nice to go in feeling clean and come out full and still feeling clean, unlike some other establishments I've been in.
Quite nice actually, not greasy, the cilantro help to give a brightness to it, pickled chinese radish gave a crunchy texture as well as a bit of sourness that matches well. Oysters were minced into smaller pieces but distributed fairly evenly.
We order at least once a month and it never fails to disappoint. The vegetables are cooked perfectly every time and the sauces are fantastic! Kung Pao is my favorite.
After 4 years being stuck outside their delivery zone I am exited to be back in, and so is my husband because he doesn't have to go pick it up anymore.
Food lacked in flavor...however, the presentation was decent and the quality was good. I wouldn't come back though...it's pricey and I think I prefer cheap sloppy fake "Chinese food" from Panda express or your local wok anyways.
This is a great Chinese restaurant in the New York - New York Hotel & Casino. My husband and I grabbed a quick dinner here before a show and it was a great choice. 
The BF wanted paper wrapped chicken which came with good sized "meatballs" about 8 I think in a order. Pretty tasty juicy little chicken meatballs with a sweet based soy sauce to dip. 
Okay this place does some of the best food in town, but the only reason i gave it two stars is because of the service ,it was bad the only time I've been here. They didn't offer our table drinks and it took awhile for them to ask us if we were ready to order. I do plan on going back sometime just to give them another chance.
Our order came and the salted fish wasn't what he had expected, and to me the fish was the ocean equivalent of eating limburger cheese. This dish could have been 'salted fish' but my husband didnt want it. So he politely asked if it could be taken back, the waiter went to speak with the manager... well this somehow offended the manager, and he very angrily said he would not take it back, and since he was with an "oriental' - im filipina by the way- he should have known what the salted fish would be.
SERVICE: Mediocre, not too much too complain about, generally nice when ordering
Have ordered a wide variety of their dishes and this is the best Chinese I've found in the East Valley.   
Pork Fried Rice for $4.95- This dish should have been called the Pork with MSG fried rice. Holy cow! No wonder my leg was tingling shortly after eating this.  I'm sure they cook the rice with oyster sauce and soy sauce, just to name a few.  The rice did have a good pork to rice ratio.  Brownie points!
I enjoyed the ginger salmon with green beans instead of bok choy and mushrooms, it was definetly yummy! Shanda did an excellent job of making everything timely and just the way I wanted it.  The kale salad was excellent as well for a starter.
It seems as if the restaurant was recently remodeled inside.  The decor was new and up to date with style, unlike some Chinese restaurants I have been to.  There was a mixed blend of cultures present, also including the staff.  We got there in time for happy hour, so we ended up getting our beers for fairly cheap!
Had their lettuce wraps - only complaint was they only give u 2 leafs of lettuces.  wth?  Had to ask for some more and got 2 more.. which actually was enough for the rest...
I had the regular noodles with the Beef/Oyster sauce and it did not disappoint.  My friend got a larger size of noodle and said that it was a little too much noodle and she would go with regular next time but the food was still very good.  I ordered the egg rolls which were very "meh" but the noodles more than made up for it.  
Ok, saying something is better than something else doesn't necessarily mean the item being compared to is "bad." The other thing is just better.
This place has quickly become our favorite local chinese joint.  The food is quick and cheap.  Much better than most of the chinese places around the Glendale/West Phoenix area.  It's very nice and clean inside if you want to dine in.  Can't say that for other chinese places.
As for comments re: the premises...true, it is not a new or modern building, but it was not dirty, nor did it smell greasy or nasty (and I'm a big one on "smells"...left two other places because of the smell alone.) The folks were friendly and ready exactly when they said it would be.
Order the Sesame Chicken!
The food was definitely the star of the show.  We ordered a little bit of everything and everything was impressive.  Even the vegetarian options were filling and satisfying.
Pretty clean for a Chinese Restaurant, you will not be disappointed.
When you walk into Shanghai Lilly you'll notice it has a very elegant interior. From the high ceilings to the long draping curtains, this is one of the fanciest Chinese restaurants I have stepped into.
Will not return. sorry!

This place has become a cult favorite here at my dealership.  It went from daring each other to try it to eating here twice a week for some of us.  The lunch specials here give you the most bang for the buck, and the food is pretty good too.
The service is prompt and friendly. It is a very casual atmosphere no need to dress up here. The food coming out of the kitchen is just good, real Chinese food.
Overall... no thanks.
Left very disappointed. $27 (pre-tip) is way overpriced for dim sum.. especially if it's low quality. 
So far, everyone I've taken here has liked it.  My favorites are the General Chicken and Sweet n Sour Chicken (I know, yawn, right?)  The dinner portions are big enough to feed two people, and we upgrade to fried rice for $2.  The curry was so-so, and the shrimp stir-fry was ok.  Parking is horrible, however - but well-worth the walk if you end up a block away.  :-)
Warning: check out the place before you place the order.
Tried some more traditional fare at book club.  The jellyfish salad, chicken, crab, and dumplings were all delish-- crab and chicken were a little work but worth it.  We had it take-out and it was really good.
I like to judge a chinese restaurant by their shrimp fried rice.  It tells me how good their chef is with flavor, how fresh the ingredients are since it is seafood, and how powerful the wok is to get that nice finish for the fried rice.
When we got here, the main dinning area was full, so we took the seats at the bar.  It was fine since it was only my fiance and I.  The hot pot seems to be a popular choice among diners. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2YBO1LEKIgyle0uX50u15Q?select=Az6cgBtuJVm3LncNV5kNNg http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2YBO1LEKIgyle0uX50u15Q?select=V7IkrP393iz-ZCaPcblS3A  I saw pots after pots being delivered.  And I was very happy to get mine!
It was a good change.
Wow was this place great! Most of the patrons in there were chinese speaking people of college so right off I knew this was going to be good autthentic chinese food. We ordered so pretty tame items but the flavor was out of this world. Great Service even though the place was PACKED. We will definitely be going back.
Not many vegetarian options (please add more!)
Well ...you been to one Panda Express you've been to them all.  It serves a purpose of getting a healthy plateful of fair chinese fare!   So there! :)
Used to come here a lot and always found the food to be good but the service to be horrible.  Lo and behold, they listened to the complaints and really upped the service to beyond good, it's actually amazing.  
--Kobi beef fried rice:  Pretty good, but ground kobi sort of loses it's luster.  I know it's supposed to be "the best", but when you grind it up, it almost tastes the same as regular ground chuck.  ALMOST.  
Got the vegetable and ham rice which was the best thing we ordered.  The beef noodle soup was just ok and all 3 cold items (spicy beef, pork intestine and soy bean/vegetable) were also.  Disappointed since I'm a big fan of spicy Chinese food (Yunnan, Sichuan, Human) but this place just fell short.  Won't be going back since I liked the old restaurant at this location more.
Geee-ross!  The other half and I got take-out for this place.   But first a little back-story....  My dad's whole family worked at a Chinese restaurant in Philly from before I was born until the late 1990's.  My mother says she craved Chinese food the whole time she was pregnant with me and by proxy got me hooked on Chinese in the womb. I bless her for having done so. I love Chinese and could eat it every day...willingly.  I've tried Chinese in every city and country I've ever lived or visited, as I always love to see what's out there and experience the regional variances and interpretations. I can usually find something good, no matter how nasty or base a buffet, or made-to-order.  And Lord knows I love take-out and a movie on the sofa.  Great nite, rite?
WORSE GENERAL TSO CHICKEN AND CRAB RAGOONS EVER!!!!
The dumplings were VERY VERY good.  I haven't had anything better in Phoenix.  Even thought it's under the appetizer category, these dumplings (8 of them for $5) were humongous!  Not only were they huge, the dough was home made.  Very chewy and fresh.  They were the best I've had in restaurants in many years!  They were so good that we ordered 'to-go' order for the dumplings! 
We ordered the Beef & Broccoli, the Kung Pao Vegetables, the Sweet & Sour Pork, Crab Puffs, and all of that came with rice.  The total was about $30.  Not a bad value considering we ended up eating that as two meals between two people.  Chinese food is good that way.
My husband's absolutely favorite is the hot and sour soup, he is a total hot and sour soup snob and he loves this one.  I often stop there just to pick up a big container of it for him.  The crab rangoons are really good too, not greasy and lots of filling.  The General Tao's chicken is one of our favorites but the sauce is a little different than most Chinese restaurants.  I absolutely adore the mu shu chicken and anything in kung pao sauce is divine.   The fried rice is really delicious too; we always order it with beef.  My new favorite is the chow fun noodles house special (pork, chicken and shrimp.)  If you like lo mein try the chow fun for something different.  Its flat rice noodles.
Tried out this new local Chinese eatery that just opened in the Food4Less center. They had been sending out promotional advertising in the local mail with their menu and being a lazy hot 100+ degree Saturday-day, decided to give them a try. Ordered 4 things for the family. Mongolian Beef was about as good as I have had in Las Vegas (but extremely hot with firecracker peppers) and the beef was very tender and easy to eat. Also got an order of Combination Kung Pao, which also was very good, with lots of shrimp. Appetizer platter was very good and so where the pot stickers and chicken won ton balls. The only drawbacks (for me) were the pot stickers are fried instead of steamed (but still delicious) and the firecracker peppers (will remember to order it without them next time). Service was quick & prompt, and food arrived extremely quick. Overall = A- . The flyer says they deliver locally and have lunch & dinner "packages" to fit your style. I definitely pray their food quality does not decline once they get into a standard swing of things, but for now will definitely go back & I do recommend.
THE CHILLY!! the chilly casted a spell on us. how can there be such a good chilly made? spicy and sweet at the same time. even better than the one i made. comparable to indonesian chilly. it was so good my korean friend and i each requested for some to be taken home. 
We made a reservation and were seated immediately, cha-ching. We were all overwhelmed with the menu as honestly EVERYTHING looked spectacular. At the recommendation of our waiter as well as a friend, we ordered:
I went here for lunch during a business trip last week and was pleased with my meal and experience. I really liked the funky decor and couldn't stop looking around. It has an all white interior with orange accents including large fish tanks full of orange gold fish. the white tables have orange accents with the beautiful blown glass glasses. I wish I could have taken one home!
This was the worst Panda Express I've ever had ! My sister warned me not to go here but me being the fat ass that I am, decided to go anyways. The fried rice wa clearly old or burned and the white rice was too clumpy to eat. They continue to mix old food with old food and had no fresh meat besides the orange chicken. And to top it off I PAID 8 dollars! Thumbs down, panda.
We wouldn't go back again!
Stopped into Wendy's Noodle cafe for lunch with a few of my co-workers.  The atmosphere was a clean well staffed asian diner.  We were promptly greeted and seated.  The menu had the usual asian offerings with greater focus on noodle dishes. I ordered the Beef Lo-Mein ($6.95), Potstickers ($5.95) and XO Green Bean (Spicy and very good $9.95) and everything was very good.  I usually judge asian dishes based on how much soy sauce I have to add for flavor, and in this case I didn't need to add any, the dish was very tasty as served!  Overall the wait staff was friendly and helpful explaining dishes and I had a very positive experience.
Anyone who criticizes this place for not being healthy or REAL Chinese food...DUH (thank you Captain Obvious!) That's like downgrading Coldstone for not being homemade or healthy ice cream!  To each their own I guess but I've never come here to feel like I was in China or eating clean, healthy food.
The Good: It's Chinese food open late when your're hungry and craving something greasy.
primarily for the Sichuan beef noodle soup fresh from the pot.
When I arrived I already had an idea of what I wanted. The man that greeted me at the counter was very professional and polite. He handed me a menu and asked what I would like. I explained that I wanted the mongolian beef. As I was ordering I looked back into the kitchen and it appeared to be very clean. This menu item comes with a bowl of white rice. He asked if I would like a drink as well. Usual service, but done very professionally. I received my food quickly and it was very tasty! The portion sizes are generous and filling. While I was enjoying my meal another patron entered the restaurant and made a large order. When the order was completed the restaurant staff proceded with her food out the front door to load it for her. I was shocked that they didn't offer to do it and just did it! That is great customer service!!
Served w/ Soup, Fried Wontons (several side sauces plum, duck and serious mustard).
Okay, i have good news :)  Very happy to say that the new owners of the Golf Chef are doing a much better job.  The new service staff and owner are very personable.  They check in on you to make sure everything is good.  The menu looks the same but I think they are using a better food supplier now and their ingredients seem to taste a little fresher.  Under the old owners, I think their chicken had a weird after taste, but not now.  
When it comes to the Panda call me...ummm...Panda? (no witty comment). I make it a goal to eat at Panda Express at every chance I can muster. I enjoy their clean fresh presentation style, and open kitchen, made to order(close to) entrees. If you are new to their food, or havnt been within the last 6 months, be sure to try their new sweet fire chicken. However(there is always a flip side) this resturante wont give you the experience that Mr. Panda is known to provide. This location is dirty, the noodles are never fresh (ate here twice), and the in-store dinning is not too appealing. 
It was crushed, leaking out of the containers and was so mixed up I wasn't even sure if it was what I really ordered.  Half of the order was already cold.
The dishes ranged from rice dishes, a couple of dim sum options, moo shu, rice porridge, to noodle soups, wok-tossed noodles, and soups. With two, you should order at least two dishes, with each dish around $12-16. I wouldn't say the atmosphere is the best, because you're basically sitting in an open-area restaurant in the middle of the casino, but it suits the fast-casual experience. 
This is really good NY style Chinese. Try the Chow Fun! It was awesome. We also loved the fried rice and the Walnut Shrimp. The Duck was a bit gamey but very good.
The orange chicken meal came with a good portion of chicken, white rice, fresh steamed broccoli and fresh fruit (apple, kiwi, grapes, strawberry). The orange chicken, its not the Panda Express orange chicken and while not as orange flavored as I like, it was very good, the rice perfectly steamed and chopstick friendly. The broccoli well steamed and still crisp, kudos! What I really liked was the fresh fruit. They did make an effort within the carry out container to separate the fruit from the meat/sauce with the rice and broccoli as buffers, but a little got through, definitely not a deal breaker for me.
Don't miss out!! Treat yourself to this Asian spot.
No. 16 on the menu for any vegetarian is a blessing! Try it. Plus at $5 it is a freaking deal! I have also tried the salt and pepper prawns. They are awesome! They work fast and our food was out in no time. The mango juice with boba drink is really good. Can't wait to go back here again. They keep the place clean and running smoothly.
Spicy City has taken over the New Shanghai.  We went today for lunch and we all thought it was pretty good.  The dining room has been repainted but still has big cardboard boxes in the corner LOL.  The kitchen looked clean.
+ Food is quite good, better than expected
Recommendation: Don't come here for the food but if you like to look at gold fish, this is the place for you. Also, if you like all white decor, you won't be disappointed here.
I always get the Fish fillet with Sampan congee (Yu peen tang jai jok), Seafood congee, and chinese donut (yau ja gwai).
Like most people we did everything family style so we can try a bunch of dishes. We had the Mongolian Beef, General Tsaos Chicken, and Seafood Lettuce Wraps. Each dish was light, fresh, and delicious. I was very happy with our choice and would defiantly come back here again.
Hot and Sour Soup 
Service here is like no other restaurant in our area.  It's simply the best.  
First things first, no waiter was to be found about ten minutes later they gave us our water and left again! It wasn't even busy! There were only TWO dim sum carts floating around somewhere. Then our waiter finally came around and took our orders of lunch entrees. The food was not even that good as the reviews that are posted on here. When we came up to pay, the bill was super overpriced. I will not be returning here, I am better off eating at Great Wall Cuisine.
They don't clear your plates when you are done either.
Wanting Chinese delivery bad, I went to the nearest one...that delivered that is. I didn't expect much, even from a place I never ate at before, and not surprisingly, Golden Rice Express didn't let me down. 
Overall: A
Great food and fast service. Loved the chicken fried noodles.
So I decided to go here after it received a good review in one of the Vegas coupon books and a Chinese breakfast buffet sounded interesting.  I loved the New York/New York hotel and casino but Chin Chin was a dissappontment.  The buffet was small and the only Chinese offerings were fried rice with sausage (really?) and some sort of egg roll...still not sure what was inside.  The wait staff looked really unhappy.  It was just ok.
Several times throughout the meal they came and asked if I needed anything.  They really look after their customers to make sure you are happy and have everything you need during your meal.
I really try to be understanding about food taking some time. I am very willing to wait for quality food. Its actually my tagline for yelp...however, this place takes too long to get my to go chow mein out, I mean...its chow mein! I order it because its quick.
The square it's located in had a quince store (store specifically for quincinera dresses) and some place (I will assume) sells TVs/used electronics.
I've had better.  Nice decor though.
For the price this place beats Pei Wei by a mile...  The serving size is very ample and the service is very fast!  I enjoyed Kung Pao Chicken with Brown Rice on my first visit.  At first I thought I would need a take out box when I saw the size of the dish, then I was real hungry and managed to down it all in one sitting.. The Price was under $9 with tax and no drink..   I would recommend giving this place at least one try if you are a Pei Wei fan or just like Fast Asian food.. Lots of varieties and a very clean diner..
Eggrolls .. another bummer .. excuse me where is the meat ?! STRICTLY CABBAGE !! I paid for egg rolls wrapped with cabbage deep fried !! Really & paid 2/$1.75 so not worth it ( my family never ate it coz it had no flavor or MEAT ! my mom makes better lumpia :) ) 
We have been to this restaurant twice and both times was great. Sushi is wonderful, just stay away from the saki. It is awful. 
Here are the photos of what we ate.
I figured out why I never liked Chinese food when I first ate at Asian Cafe Express. It's because everything I've had has been Americanized Chinese Food!!!  It was like an epiphany and seriously music to my tastebuds when I actually found Chinese food I not only liked, I LOVED! Having authentic Chinese food changed my opinion completely about this cuisine.
- No MSG. Enough said.
Flavorless lo mein and almost out dated beef (it tasted and smelled funny). Shrimp friend rice was edible but not the next day. The egg drop soup had a metal flavor to it like it had been canned for years =P
Here is the skinny - Food was okay, a little too salty for my tastes, BUT! service and trickery was at an all time high at this place.
Oh God how I wish we had a Wo Fat in L.A....
The orange chicken is a favorite, and the lo mein is always good. The crab puffs (I think they call them angels on the menu) are super yummy. I confess, I have ordered the crab puffs and an egg roll for dinner before. Don't judge.
Great food. Not over deep fried. Highly recommend.
sadly, i got out of practice...now i look at the damn thing like every other american and wonder. wtf it is that thing.
My husband and I just moved into the neighborhood, not far from this restaurant.  The week we moved in, we took his parents to try this place in hopes of it being a new favorite Chinese food place.  It was a complete waste of money and a total disappointment.
Ok that's all I remember.  Oh and don't be fooled the oyster omelette is just an omelette with oyster in it. It's not the taiwanese o'a j'ian.  But it still tastes good.
FB page doesn't work - hurting takeout business!
Yes, it's a super cheap lunch for around $5-6 but remember...you get what you pay for sometimes.  At this China Star it's not much.  The food is decent and you won't have any problems if you've got a strong stomach like I do.  There are your usual dishes like the fried rice, noodles, fried chicken wings, beef and broccoli, and won ton soup.  But I just feel it's all on lower standards.  A lot of the stuff on the day I went was definitely sitting under the heat lamp for a bit, causing a lot of items to be surrounded by a pool of grease.  Ever see coconut chicken after a long bath under a heat lamp?  Trust me you don't want to.  Things tasted rubbery and lackluster.  Soup was cold and the faux sushi was warm.  Wow, and I'm not usually very picky when it comes to eating!  Sad food make me a sad boy.
The food was great, the servers were awesome! I like the food here, they have great portions and my favorite is the green bean chicken! :o)
I did take out and of course they were quick as the soup is one of the standards that are always ready.
I like the beef Szechwan noodles and rice dish.
I just came to this restaurant for a wedding dinner. I have to say that the decor is nice and it looked promising. 
And I wish that I could give them an extra star for having chinese almond cookies and jasmine tea. Yum!!
The chef came out as dessert was served to visit with our host and meet my husband.  He is fascinating, the dessert, not so much...it was a red bean tapioca soupy sort of thing -- ok, it was the only miss for me -- but again, no complaints since it was complimentary... 
Service wasn't that bad. The waitress came by frequently to check on us despite the growing number of people starting to show up for lunch. 
Beer and crazy alcoholic drinks that you would only order in a place like this - check
I had a lunch special of Hunan Chicken yesterday. It included pork fried rice and hot and sour soup.
I would come here everytime I visit LV. However this visit was sort of a disappointment. The good quality was just so-so. Maybe my expectations were high from our last visit. We ordered an additional claypots and were told they don't have that for the evening huh? We just ordered through another server a few minutes ago. needless to say, the server never came back. So we didn't know if the second order was placed or not. Anyways,  we left without ordering our favorite steamed egg dessert.
If you are tired of franchised Chinese food that all tastes the same try this Chinese restaurant. White table clothes with hot tea and fried won tons remind me of Chinese restaurants before Pei Wei and P.F. Chang's. My boyfriend is an Asian foodie and loves this place.
    fee, driver tip and a few extras (more water cress, more pork in the 
The menu is pretty straight forward, pick the ingredients of the mini hot pot you would like (currently there are 10 options), then add any optional side orders of meat, seafood and vegetables, and finally specify the desired spiciness level.  If you are not sure how much heat you want in your personal cauldron of bubbling goodness, go easy and add chili from the dipping sauce station or other condiments to taste.
The deep fried shrimp were akin to eating cake-covered shrimp, and were not good. 
So when she gives us the bill she asks us 
My litmus test is Kung Pao Chicken. GH uses good quality chicken in an oh-so-tasty sauce that I mop up with rice when the chicken's gone. I'm not a big fan of orange chicken (it's usually a gloppy mess of gristly meat), but GH again uses good meat and fries it to a perfect crispiness that stands up to the sweet sauce. My wife, a tofu lover, is addicted to their deep-fried pillow tofu (seriously, try it). In over 10 visits, every single dish we've tried has been a winner.
They deliver as well, and the last time I ordered from them I have to say it look a very long time for the food to arrive. Having only one driver in a student heavy area must be stressful! I have also had dinner there, and there was nothing to complain about, from the service to the food! The desserts were especially impressive, and would have been more at home at a patisserie than a chinese restaurant!
I have had take it from here several times and each time the food has been really good.  I keep meaning to stop in to check out the bar but just have not had the time. I would have to say this is one of my favorite Chinese food places and its convenient.  
-Good, friendly service
We ordered this as delivery on a Saturday afternoon. Delivery time seemed decent. 
Disgusting fake Chinese food is all I can say. This place is for people who want  to valet park and drink wine. This is a place for people to think they are eating Chinese food when they are not. This restaurant disgusts me. The reason I came here was because I was invited as a guest. I would never come here on my own accord
The salt and pepper squid had way too much breading on each piece and needed more seasoning.  The ground pork and salty fish strangely had no texture.  I've had this dish many times but this was the first time that it was just extremely mushy, tasted fine.  The BBQ combo, too much to complain about.  The Singapore noodles was by far the best thing and a great filler since the plate was huge.
But I will say this dishes are prepared well. You don't see any of the pale watery chicken dishes that you observe at most other "good Chinese restaurants" that you witness in the Valley. If you live in the immediate area, you will not be disappointed getting carry out but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.
For Chinese food, THIS PLACE IS THE BOMB! It's not a fast food greasy take out joint!!! This is a little cozy spot, very low key but Oh man let me tell you the food is great! My kids get the beef broccoli and usually I'll get the sun devil chicken or the orange chicken with steamed rice, It's not over breaded and the meat is all white no skin! Soooooooooooooo yummy! Prices are super good too, very inexpensive meal! I promise! Abacus you rock!
Food: 4
Continue down the line and you will find an order counter with a large display menu and an even larger non pictured menu. This is all made to order gastrohappiness. You'll find everything from the Americanized dishes to the crazy things you see them eat on your favorite travel channel/discovery shows.
The beef is sliced thin and put in a bowl along with baby bok choy and some other leafy stuff. That big bowl is filled with broth, lots of pepper flakes, and hot oil; everything is red from the pepper flakes. The spice makes you sweat and want to keep eating more and more, and I made it through half the bowl before feeling stuffed. Very nice heat, with ok flavor underneath it. It seems like the focus is all about the heat, so it's difficult to determine of the food actually tastes good. The bok choy was fresh tasting and a nice complement to the dripping in sweat heat of the bowl. 
Singapore rice noodles: Surprisingly good. Had a slightly spicy curry taste to it, would definitely order again.
Over the last few years, the quality (and quantity) of the ingredients has been going downhill.  Years ago the chow mein was made with good-quality, thick noodles - which are now much thinner and (tonight) over-cooked.  I ordered Shrimp Chow Mein (which I used to love) for pick-up - when we got it back home we received a pound and a half of over-cooked noodles (I actually weighed it) along with approx. 1/4 cup of veggies comprised mainly of onions, a little carrot & some cabbage and literally 7 medium-small sized shrimp (I counted). Ridiculous noodle-to-anything-else-ratio. 
Credit cards are accepted here, but when I gave them my AmEx card (there is a AmEx sticker along with the usual suspects on the front door) but was asked to pay with a different card (because American Express charges a higher fee - perhaps, but more likely due to AmEx not distributing the funds to their merchant clients for an entire billing cycle). Yeah, pretty much all the small vendors are hating on AmEx, and to think (if you are old enough) that they once dominated the credit card market. Oh how the mighty has fallen indeed.  
Other sides we went for were hubby's fave eggplant and garlic sauce along with stir fried peashoots which is a staple in dining out Cantonese menus. Average taste and not disappointing and also not a bad location for us going forward as we'd like to try other faves like crispy egg noodle stir frys as well as the hot pots.
One thing I noticed while walking in/out of the Monte Carlo was that there were barely any people in Dragon Noodle. At all times. Despite this, my boyfriend and I decided to give it a go since we had some food/beverage credit to use.
Finally there is a Chinese takeout place close to where I live that is actually good!  It's a very small restaurant and they seemed swamped but handled it well.  The server/phone operator/take out staff (all one person) gave me a bowl of egg drop soup while I waited for my take out, which was nice.  All while handling two dine-in tables, phone orders, and other people waiting for take-out.  
* There's a "house special" board in the restaurant, but I can't read it because it is written in Mandarin (or perhaps Cantonese...I'm not sure exactly which it is).
- large servings
Excellent food. Good atmosphere. Don't let the outside fool you, The Prime is quite possibly the best Chinese food in the state.
I understand the need for pricing, but with that I feel too high is the current prices.
This place is old school. You can tell the food is made from fresh ingredients - not pre-mixed, pre-packaged, like other Chinese places. 
Overall: 
Yessss a great noodle house this is
Very typical strip mall-ish take out joint. Nothing special at all. Service is minimal and its obvious they just want to get your money and you to get out ASAP. Food was overcooked quite a bit and just not good.
Minus 1 star for the bathroom cleanliness tho
The only thing I've tried and didn't like was the chop suey - it just wasn't what I expected.  It had a lot of sauce and not many crunchy vegetables.  It tasted good, it just wasn't what I wanted at the time.
If you do get forced to go here, do not get anything other than shrimp... I shudder at the quality of the other meat, just thinking about it days later.
Since I had never been there before, and I will eat pretty much anything that doesn't eat me first, I allowed Foodie Bear to order the food! When the waitress came to the table he immediately ordered the baked pork chop. I don't know if she even got out her greeting. The Bear knows what the Bear wants! Apparently this dish takes a while to cook. We also picked the Peking pork ribs, I believe some orange chicken, and an order of fried rice. As an appetizer, I tried a spring roll. 
Good and ok. Not the best dim sum but we had a nice variety. Fed 7 people (3 kids) on the 4 person ultimate banquet thing
I can't say enough good things about this place. We visit Grand Dragon several times a month. This is the best Chinese food in Phoenix, the portions are great! I always have enough leftover for another meal, and the prices are reasonable. The service is eager to please, and they always seem genuinely pleased to see us. They don't mind making a few modifications for our picky tastes, either. Major score, Grand Dragon. I absolutely am in love with their lo mein noodles, which had a slight smoky flavor. 
Total hole in the wall and in weird/sketchy area. This place is one of the most authentic chinese food I've ever had.
-Beef dish, not much beef...mostly veggies vs the meat ratio...$8.95. Not a good value.
We still go to Golden Harvest regularly and enjoy it as much as ever. The lo mein has good "wok hey" and the Mongolian beef the best I've had anywhere -- and it's consistently that good.
The food's not terrible but the problem is when you order a meat dish such as Mongolian Beef you get about 5 pieces of beef and then they mask the rest of it with the onions and bell pepper so you think you're getting a big meal.  I've gotten other beef dishes there and it's the same thing.  If you like more veggies than meat then this is your place!
I'm slowly drifting off into chinese food coma, with leftovers in the fridge.  Things are looking up... Tomorrow's Friday, I got some tasty leftovers for lunch, and it's payday!
This is quite possibly the best Chinese food I've ever had. We ordered a variety of dishes off the menu. The items that stood out the most were the pork Lo Mein (best ever), the general tso's chicken, and the Mongolian Beef. I usually love walnut shrimp, but there's had a bit too much of a seafood taste to it (if that makes sense). Overall, we were all very satisfied and would come back again.
Wow, no thanks.  The food here was tasteless.  I tried very hard to convince myself and my table of colleagues that Blossom was aiming for the highly refined palate, and we were to "experience the essence of ginger" in our very bland potstickers.  There was hope in the delicious bowls of vegetarian hot and sour soup (although not very hot and very expensive at $10 a bowl -- more like a cup).  After this, our hopes were dashed repeatedly, first with the kung pao chicken that had no "pao" in it and second with the crispy sea bass that had large pieces of bone.  One person received a piece with vertebrae and hardly any fish meat to try.  I ordered the tofu and shiitake mushroom dish, which on most accounts tends to be bland to begin with.  I enjoyed this the most; the tofu was high quality and silky, and the mushrooms were fresh.  Unfortunately, my table mates were disappointed even with the hot sauces and chiles they requested on the side.  If you like real authentic Chinese food, you will be disappointed by the lack of flavor and the high prices here.
Noodles great.  First place that makes chow fun without black bean sauce....make sure you request it :)
Low-priced chinese buffet - I definitely like this place better than Jane V. (the previous reviewer). I think the food is very good. Restaurant not dirty at all, though it is on Charleston - not the greatest area, but not terrible either. The shrimp in coconut sauce is my fave and all the other selections are tasty and filling. Good barbecued pork and a sushi bar (which I am not personally into); no complaints about the food, but sometimes the patrons are a bit seedy... still a solid buffet - I recommend it!
I've always enjoyed the Chinese, Asian fusion that is offered at Red 8.
this was an ok experience....
Broccolini in Ginger Sauce - The crisp broccolini was served in pieces that were 12" - 18" long.  Given that knives (and chopsticks) were not part of our place settings, we had no choice but to fork these annonyingly drippy (yet crunchy!) spears into our oral cavities with little dignity.  I tasted no ginger at all and the veggies seemed to be drenched in the same generic brown spooge as the K.P. Seafood 2.
If you're looking for some yummy, American-style Chinese take-out in Laveen... Lis Bowl is the way to go.
Tomato Beef Noodle 
I have been to P.F. Chang's many times and always had a decent experience but it was never at the top of my list until I enjoyed their Happy Hour menu.  My husband and I have now been quite a few times and have tried many of the items.  My favorite would have to be the well known Chicken Lettuce Wraps. You can never go wrong with those and even better when they are at the cheaper happy hour price.  I enjoy the selection of street tacos that they have to offer, my favorite being the Mahi Mahi tacos.  They are served in twos and actually have two pretty substantial pieces of fish on each.  I was happy to see their Crab Wontons (which actually have a good amount of crab in them-unlike some places)  made it onto the happy hour menu as well. Probably my most notable find was the Coconut Lemon Sour on the cocktail menu. Not too sour, not too sweet and perfect for the hot Vegas summers.  On a non food note, this location added some additional booth seating to the middle of their dining area instead of tables and chairs. My party and I found them be much more comfortable then the previous set up.
-Crab and sweet corn soup: Delicious and great to eat with the chilly weather.  The corn was definitely sweet corn and you can find chunks of crab meat in the soup.
We had to pay almost $5.00 for a bowl of RICE!  I could not believe that the main dish did not come with anything else.  Everything is ordered separately.  I know it's Caesar's at the Las Vegas strip, but please, four entrees, four bowls of rice and three teas, one had water, cost over $100 for lunch!!!
I give the restaurant five stars for the LOOK of the place - really classy spot.  We had such high hopes that this would be our next big ticket Chinese restaurant to replace one of our favorites - Chinois by Wolfgang Puck, but alas, save your money and go to PF Chang's - you'll get better food there all the way around without paying so much for the so-so food.  Got there early when they opened (they were late opening for a 5PM reservation start time, which is irrupting as we had tickets to The Beatles Love and was trying to pace ourselves 2 hours to eat and get to the show in The Mirage.  We ordered the BBQ Rib appetizer - usually a favorite for us, but these were just awful.  I can' find anything really to recommend about these except they were a good size - you got four - but the sauce - was tasteless and the meat wasn't well prepared - way to tough to chew - again PF Chang's - a lesser experience - has way better ribs and probably for a fraction of the cost.  I don't mind paying top dollar for a great dining experience but we're already in trouble with appetizers.  The soup - Crab and Corn soup was also nothing exciting - just average tasting.  For main dish we had always order two items - Usually one beef and one chicken...for chicken we had the Kung Pao Chicken - this was actually the best item we ordered...had we found a better appetizer and soup and a better beef item - we might have upped this another star, but this alone wasn't worth the money we spent on this food.  For the beef, we went with the SIGNATURE DISH - Beef Tenderloin with the black pepper sauce.  You have the choice of Black Pepper or Orange Sauce - that may be a misprint in the menu - as you don't actually get any sauce - they just cook a really cheap piece of beef and put pepper on it - it was tough as nails and probably the worst piece of tenderloin beef I've ever eaten.  Sitting on a bed of some sort of julienned veggies that weren't edible - just a really nasty dish - and for this you'll be paying $45+ dollars for this "signature" dish.  Usually a signature dish is something so special, it's worth the extra money - save your dollars folks - there's probably a dozen or so terrific steak houses in Vegas that will make you a great steak meal for this price - this is NOT one of them - dried, tasteless and in general a major disappointment.  We won't be back.
c.  Ambiance - Very nice, authentic looking place, they have a very nice room in the back for parties. I think you could fit 30 people onto three tables.  This is very nice.  5 Star!
I'm editing my review from a couple of years ago--the food is still OK, although today's KungPao shrimp was REALLY spicy, a little too much. I read somewhere about the order takers--as being less than friendly, and that still applies. The middle aged Asian lady today was just one step away from being surly and the younger lady who is here sometimes isn't much better,.
Prices are reasonable.  If you do order the soup realize you can order it and share for the table.
They also padded our bill with things we didn't order, like bowls of rice and something else.... but they promptly took it off. 
This place is really underrated. If you get there before 4pm you can get the lunch portion... It's a lot of food! The banana treats they give you after your meal are delish!
This was my first time eating there. I opted for takeout. The chicken fried rice was really tasty and the chicken lo mein was also good. Looking forward to trying more of their menu.
Went there for lunch. Cashew chicken not on menu, asked and they made it for us. Place was clean, friendly staff. LARGE menu, Large portions...
We were on a holiday to Vegas and went there with a friend and his family. We order a duck, carrot cake, wanton noodle, salted fish fried rice and oyster sauce vegetable. All the dishes were nicely done and balanced, not too salty like many other chinese restaurants. The carrot cake were the best! 
There is really no time of day when it's not good to eat here. My husband and I have eaten here when it opens at 11am - congee (typical Asian breakfast), lunch, ordering noodles or rice dishes and dinner, ordering any number of items on the regular or special menu. 
Please don't think this is the same as 27th and Cactus.  They told us it was the same but is it not even close..  if your looking for the taste of Cactus location do not eat here.
The place doesn't look too fancy, nor the interior fresh, but it's the food I go for, so I simply overlook the outdated colors and carpet!  
I wanted to really like this place.  Reviews here great, person at the counter extremely nice, complimentary egg drop soup while I waited for my take out...when I got back to my place, there were no plastic utensils...potstickers were ok, rice the standard, kung pao chicken unremarkable...
King salmon sashimi
Four stars. Now, I haven't been to this place in years, and the low ratings disappoint me. I am curious to return to find out if something has changed.
I ordered the general tsao's chicken. No finer has passed through these lips. Seriously.
This place gets good reviews, but based on my one experience getting take-out I doubt I'd come back. We opted for two classic American-Chinese dishes -- mongolian beef and cashew chicken. Each dish was a ridiculously large serving, probably enough for two or three people. Too bad the quality wasn't on par with the quantity. The mongolian beef was mushy and chewy. The cashew chicken way too bland.
i think the place is pretty convenient... and the set-up is quite refreshing. however, the menu lacked a lot of things... i think it was too americanized for me. my friends and i shared multiple dishes... from chinese broccoli with oyster sauce, pan fried noodles with seafood, shrimp fried rice, and beef szechuan soup. now that soup was the best thing we had in our meal. it was so good we ordered another one. the noodles are thick wheat noodles in a sweet but spicy beef broth. the beef pieces were tender and cooked to perfection. 
The food was some of the best Chinese we've had a while. Their version of egg drop soup was outstanding. We combined House Fried Rice with Kung Pao chicken. Delicious!
The servers here were very kind and the food inexpensive but good quality.  If you are ever in the area (perhaps that is a big IF) you should give this place a try...
Las Vegas, NV 89121
- crab puffs ($2.95)
It's a place with delicious food and good value.  The people were all very personable and polite.  They answered the many questions we had since it was our first time there.  We also had dessert.  The darkest chocolate ice cream I have seen in a long time.  Yummy.  All this for under $25.  Can you believe it?  Get there!
Sun Devil Chicken .. Great
I give it 4 stars because I don't want to change their rating.  If you get the right things (which so far have been General Tsao's Chicken and Sesame Chicken), then it's good.  But some things are very mediocre to... not good.
I didn't ask him where we were headed but was pleasantly surprised because we were at the Cofco Chinese Cultural Center, never been and have always wanted to go check out, was kinda disappointed in how small it was. Walked around and checked out a few things still wasn't sure of the reason we were here, then we walked into Szechwan Palace and I thought gosh this is cute little place.
Another thing. Their drinks. They give you a styrofoam cup to fill yourself which is cool, but they don't have a lid for that size. Makes me think they purposefully did this so you wouldn't take any drink with you.
Great Wall: Wow! The dessert was just SO spectacular, the great wall is basically a huge block of different layered ice cream with a crumbly chocolatey bottom.  The block is covered with melted, slightly crispy on the outside marshmallow.  It's served with raspberry puree, and another kind of puree (excuse my bad memory).   There's also a cup made out of some kind of sweet cracker thingie, filled with the most amazing whip cream and sliced fruit.  Ugh, just so good!
Really good. But sorry, definitely not Pei Wei. Can taste the deep friedness. Greasy. Less chicken than bread. No fresh veggies. Cheaper tho.
It took about 10 mins and in the mean time they bring you complimentary egg drop soup with crunch rice noodles. I am not a fan of egg drop soup but the bf said its the best hes had! Even my 5 yr old loved it! Our food came out and I was floored! Everything is served on Styrofoam plates (huge ones!) and it was filled! The chow fun had huge pieces of shrimp, chicken, and beef! The noodles were AMAZING and I was in love with my choice!! It was enough for 2 plus still A LOT to take home! The chicken fried rice was AMAZING! I know... how hard could it be to nail CFR? Other places I've gone were hard rice, not enough chicken, or a small portion... NOT HERE! The portion was HUGE! Chicken pieces were huge and plenty and it also had carrots, bean sprouts, and peas. The lunch portion orange chicken was GIANT! It came in a to go container and it was filled to the top! It included lo mein and fried rice as well, the bf said it was totally delish!
As far as the food, it is definitely not my favorite Chinese ever, however, the flavors are decent and they give you a pretty fair portion.  We always go with the General Tso's chicken, Lo Mein, and Dumplings.  Go with fried dumplings, as opposed to the steamed (they're always kind of flimsy).  Lo Mein is normally pretty good.  The ease of online ordering and the fact that overall it's been good is what keeps us still eating Hot Wok.
 From my pictures you see first hand that I love the shrimp. When I eat here I feel spoiled and catered to. The staff are respectful and the place is clean. I give them 2 thumbs up and a yey! along with fifty billion stars. oh and a cabbage patch dance :)
Oh my! Tried this place for the first time tonight - will not be going back. Egg drop soup - not good, egg rolls - not good, General's Chicken - worst I've ever had. The broccoli in the entree smelled bad, it was the first time I've ever had General's Chicken with a deep red coating on the chicken and no sauce. Heck - I didn't even get a fortune cookie - what kind of Chinese place is this. The prices were good compared to other Chinese places but it really doesn't matter if the food isn't any good.
Ate here with my little brother this past summer while my parents checked out some seafood buffet at another hotel. Somehow he managed to get all the crap genes in the family and they thought it'd be a waste to bring a seven year old (who's also severely allergic to seafood) to a $50+ seafood buffet. Wait was substantial. Atmosphere was cozy, Pearl turned out to be smaller than I expected. If I remember correctly they served sushi, but it was labeled as a Chinese restaurant. Whatever. Our waitress was nice and apologetic when I had to send my brother's plate of ribs back. They were sprinkled in peanuts. Something else he's deathly allergic too. If I had been twenty-one at the time and sitting with some cute guy instead of my little brother who kept insisting on using his chopsticks as part of some impromptu drum set, I'm sure this review would have been more interesting. Definitely a cute little place to take a date.
this is my first time being here so 3 stars.. Food was quick, not sure if i like that or not... most places ive been to i usually wait about 5-8 mins... but i will try it again... Portions are about what i expected for a lunch special
The food here is very good.  Most of the Chinese Food in Las Vegas sucks.  Food Express is one of the few good restaurants in Las Vegas.  Don't let the name fool you.  The food was made for Chinese tastes.  If you see Chinese people in a Chinese Restaurant, then that passes the tastes tests.
Minimum for credit card use is $15, so order enough or bring cash.
Me:"Can I have a boba drink too?"
You want great chinese food with good prices and service this place is the real deal!! Came here last night everything was on point from the food to service to prices would definetly recommend
OK, I don't know why, but htis place has several names depending on which website you visit. Currently it is called Karen's Unicorn, and the food and service are impeccable. We ended up here as all of the rest of the Stephan St. establishments were closed after 10:00 PM. Truly a Stockbridge gem if there is one. Outstanding Chinese food with perfect service.
Love this place!  Great food and service.  We usually get the food delivered to the our house, but have eaten in.  Absolutely love the Orange Chicken. Nice large pieces of fresh white meat chicken with very tasty Orange Sauce. 
i always get delivery from them when i'm at work. their lunch specials are so cheap!! and the amount of food they give you, is a pretty good amount for the price! its pretty tasty too.. not bland like some other restaurants! the delivery driver, which i think she's the lady who answered the phones, is very sweet!
So I then told the hostess who was also walking past and said the service was substandard and confusing, and that the first waitress didn't properly take our orders... The original waitress came back and rather than just saying it was a miscommunication (which I would have accepted), accused me of not talking loudly enough for her to hear! Number one rule in customer service - don't be aggressive and accuse the customer!! Argh. 
Met up with a friend for lunch here since we both like to try out different restaurants around the Valley. At first impression, you have a fairly nondescript building and a very narrow driveway to the parking in the back.
Great place to get Chinese food. Want to add that I left my wallet there but didn't discover it was missing till the next day. I went back and they still had it all in tack. I am soooo grateful that the girl was so honest!
Honey chicken- Good but needed rice with it. (would not order again)
This place is my favorite for good chinese for a great price. I especially love both the wet and dry beef ho-fun noodles! They get a decent char on the noodles that you can taste and it makes such a huge difference from other places that make the same dish.
Egg rolls were soggy and disgusting. Forgot to include sweet and sour sauce in the to go order. 
We ordered Orange Chicken- delicious and crispy, General Tso Chicken- so flavorful and garlic-y (yum!), Crab Puffs and Hot and Sour Soup. I always order Hot and Sour Soup, and this may sound weird, but sometimes it has a kind of barnyard flavor, but not theirs! It was just how I like it. Spicy and sour and delish. 
I also overheard the nice young waiter tell us that the owner is a former chef at Imperial Garden in Madison, one of the better Chinese restaurants in town (on the West side and East side, like most other things in this isthmus linked college campus town) apart from my near and dear beloved Hong Kong Wok in Hilldale. 
If I'm there for their lunch special that ends at 4pm I usually get their Hot Garlic chicken. Most of the lunch specials come with fried rice, chow mien and a cup of their egg drop soup. I usually dr the soup with some pepper and spice. Hey I like it hot :) 
Our two drinks and all this food only cost $26.00 before tip.
I love their minute chicken with cake noodle. The chicken is small bite size pieces crispy on outside, with good flavor through out, then the cake noodle is cut into blocks, fried until crispy but remains soft inside, and they add the sauce, it's too good to describe. 
-Sea bass on top of tofu: delicious
 
As for dinner, it is a little pricy for their dinner plates. But I would say it's definitely worth it. You get enough food to last for two or three meals, and it's delicious!
* Roast duck noodle soup - comfort food.  Tastier alternative to wonton since the duck fat has more taste.
I ordered the lemon chicken, hunan beef and lo mein.
Amazing!!! Service is always consistent and welcoming! Food is well portioned and cheap. Small location but cozy!
In fact, the following day I felt so sick after taking just a few bites of rice that, out of curiosity, I decided to check out the Dirty Diner report so I could find out if there were any Chinese restaurants around here worth going to. To my shock, but not surprise Ming Gee was at the top of the list for multiple violations. Many of the violations for things that would cause a person to have food poisoning. And that is why for the first time in my life I threw away $20 worth of food with no regrets.
Overall, would not come back.
Pretty solid Chinese food, the portions are large and the lunch specials ($5.99) before 3pm is pretty nice. I seem to order the Orange Chicken or the salt and pepper pork chop the most often.. The egg drop soup is a must as well.
Daikon
This was an amazing experience and i highly recommend it to everyone.
Best hot and sour soup I've ever had!
Friendly staff and good lunch specials, but the silence in the place was deafening! Please turn on some music!!  Also, it was not clear what items were fried or not in the descriptions of the dishes so make sure to ask.
The food was very good. I had the moo shu pork and my son had chicken lo mein. The lo mein noodles are homemade and are thick! The moo shu was well done and the owner hand wrapped them for me herself. We also had the BoBo platter which is their version of PuPu and it was the typical fare but just seemed more fresh tasting. Everything was served piping hot which as we all know is a rarity in restaurants these days. Everything was flavorful and delicious. 
The place was not very busy so I hope people give it a try!  They have American Chinese as well so something for every body.
The flaming hot beef and rice was perfect.  The beef was sweet with just a hint of the red peppers and if you wanted the kick, there were plenty of peppers mixed for you to bite into.  The seafood chow fun was lightly dusted with XO sauce giving it just a bit of a kick.  Swirls of calamari, talapia, shrimp and scallops were generously thrown into the chow fun.   The omelet was thin and heavily loaded with rice.  I had no room to try it but one of our biggest eaters could not even finish it.
Well let me start with the service which was not good at all.we have been here before and the service is always poor but this was the topping. First of all we only order 4 dishes and the place was not even half full. The first plate took 30 minutes to come out and then 15 minutes for the next one and then 15 minutes for the other.the waitress did not even come by are table at all to tell us that the food was going to take that long or even see how we were doing. After waiting 1 hour for 3 plates to come out I just wen ahead and canceled the 4th one. The worst part is that the cooks there took there break next to us in there plain uniform and all of a sudden are waitress comes out and starts serving these cooks like they where vip people. She brought out 6 dishes in less then 7 minutes and then she has the nerve to sit down next to us and eat herself. At first I thought I was on a tv show with a hidden camera but then I realized that I wasn't. So after she was done eating her little food we ask for a box to go and she had this face like someone just farted in her face, I was like whaaaaat, is she for real. 
Las Vegas, NV 89145
Some friends took us to Mr. Beijing today for an early dinner and WOW what great food!! We started off with the fried pork chops, chicken wings and chicken lettuce wraps. Then soup was served, my wife and I had the egg drop soup, and our friends had the hot and sour soup. For the main meal I had the Tomato Beef and my wife had the sweet and sour chicken, our friends had the broccoli beef and kung pao shrimp. this whole meal was insanely great!!! The owners are a husband and wife team that seem to pour their hearts into the food and service, and it truly shows!!! I will be recommending Mr. Beijing to my friends and family for sure.
Definitely 3 stars for this place because everything seems just average and no disappointment or great impression whatsoever.  Foods are alright; nothing spectacular.  Service is just A-OK as in the typical Chinatown style from which one should not expect too much.  Decors? hmmm....very minimal.  What I have enjoyed a lot is the appetizer platter; the Teochow appetizers including the slow cooked pork intestine, tofu, peanuts, etc. are made authentic and soooooo yummy! Their special marinate (soy sauce) is so tasty!
It is a typical home-style authentic chinese restaurant, and one of the best ones for authentic chinese food in Phoenix.  It has been here for a few years and we order here regularly.  The ownership has been the same since they took over the location from Yummy China (which was a pretty bad place) and the food has been consistently good.  As others here mentioned, order from the chinese menu, not the western menu.  We've tried pretty much  the entire menu and haven't found too much that we don't like.  The cook sometimes comes out and chats with you - he will make you something specific or special if you ask for it.  They do seafood (lobster, crab, shrimps) really well; their house chow mein (dry style) is HK authentic; their beef chow fun and chicken and salt fish fried rice are some of our favorite dishes.
H ad lunch here today with Rand H. and I thought this place was pretty good. It is an older building but it was still ok inside. The buffet had about 90 trays and almost everything I had was real good.Like Ryan C. says the people in here are not the classiest but the food is good enough to earn them four stars.And if you like Chinese donuts they have the best in the valley..Yay I am a fan and look forward to returning.
When I visit Vegas, I usually eat at China town instead of fancy restaurants on the strip. Saw this place a few month ago, and I decided to give it a try since it was so cold. 
The service was very good - so if you have a special occasion you can trust Rice & Co to not ruin your night out. 
So if you are in the mood for quick food for a good price. Pong pong would be my choice.
PF Chang's is a better choice if you want  expensive Chinese (even PFC is only a 4 star).  we ordered the pre-fixed menu YUK!!!  the only good thing was the vegetable dish and the spare ribs!!!
And so i say unto you, my fellow yelpers please forgive me for keeping this place a secret. I hope you try China Buffet and enjoy your visit. It's one of my favorite places to dine anywhere and I constantly use this place a measuring rod for the new chinese places I visit and they rarely compare.
Best hot and sour soup we've ever had!  It's $5 and easily serves 2 big eaters.  We were there for lunch. Great service too!
Some will say it is not authentic but if you're  looking for authentic I recommend Chinatown I spend a lot of time down there, this is not Chinatown.  Their dishes have been tamed down some for the american pallet but still quite good.   
I ordered from this place twice.  The first time was ok and the 2nd was horrible and they got my sweet and sour pork order wrong.  I tried to call in another order and the guy on the phone didn't let me explain what I wanted and told me to not order from there again if I wasn't happy.  I never went back, I think there are many other places where the food is way better than this place as well as the service.  I don't need to spend my money at a place that does not value it's customers.  Also, the place is a filthy dive.
We stopped here based on a recommendation from close friends and I can say that any negative review is emphatically incorrect.  We ordered Chicken and broccoli, Wonton soup, General Tso's Chicken and an egg roll.  The egg roll was fantastic.  The General Tso's Chicken had just the right amount of spice.  The Wonton soup was immensely flavorful.  All in all this place has a style of Chinese food as close to "New York" style as you are going to get out here in Las Vegas.  It's a total "hole in the wall" kind of place, so don't come expecting fine dining. They have a drive thru and picking food up seems easy enough. I totally recommend this place wholeheartedly and will return many times to sample the rest they have to offer.
I would rank them like this in terms of value
Great food, flavorful,fast. I've ordered many different items on the menu and have never been disappointed.
Least favorite restaurant in Vegas.  If you wanna pay $50 bucks for ramen, feel free to come by my house.
This place is pretty average for a Chinese restaurants in Phoenix. From the outside it doesn't look like much, but when you go in the dining area itself is very nice. The hostess and other staff members were very welcoming. The food itself was nothing special. I had the Yu-chan chicken. The dish was very spicy - I nice surprise! The dish was okay, but I could tell that very poor ingredients were used in its making.
Checked in with yelp and you get 2 free egg rolls. All of our dishes were hot and very good. We'll be back for sure!
I'd give this a 0 if I could. Food here is old, dry and bland. I was afraid to try anything. If it looks bad coming out, what the heck does the kitchen look like? Don't waste your money here.
- bbq honey buns
Will never come back here.. Food is tasty but they are overpriced. Just bought salt pepper pork and lemon chicken with free rice and they gave me lots of lettuce and small serving of what i ordered.
The food itself is a culinary 'meh'. It is quite nice, but very safe, with no risks taken to go for extra flavour, just the same old stuff you can get anywhere else. It is not too pricey and they do a Snapfax discount but on the other hand not too cheap either. The staff are nice but not great.  Just a bit dull all round really.
Thank God! After many trial and errors trying to find a decent Chinese restaurant that delivers, North China Restaurant fills the bill. The sesame beef, General Tso's and house lo mein are really good. Pass on the fried rice and shrimp with lobster sauce though. Those dishes aren't bad, but definitely not their best.
Based on the wonderful reviews and a friends recommendation, I was so excited to try King Wong and loved the idea that they deliver! I tried for TWO hours to reach someone to place an order. After many attempts, unanswered calls, and busy signals....I gave up and moved on.  It is unlikely that I would try again. Disappointing.
I was pretty disappointed with food.  I was guilty of believing the hype off of Yelp reviews.  I was looking forward to more big city, Cantonese or Shanghai style place.  It is not.  More of a comfort food sort of presentation.  We ate this fresh veggie salad with home made noodles.  It had a strange after taste that I could not determine the ingredient.  The flat beef dumpling was a little tasteless.  The stir fried green beans was decent.  The regular dumplings were average.  The strange taste from the veggie was the deal breaker.  The service was fast and nice.  This place needs to make adjustments.
This is my FAVORITE Chinese food place in Henderson/Las Vegas!! The food is ALWAYS good and the prices are great. I am from Chicago, so I expect good Chinese food and this place has met my expectation each time. I don't understand why out here all Chinese food places put peas and carrots in their rice and are unable to take it out....NOT here!!! They cook your food just the way you ask. I eat in and I get delivery. The guy who delivers is a real sweet heart. When I come in, he still recognizes me and ask me about my day. The food comes really quick when you get delivery. Its always hot and fresh. I just love this place and will recommend it to anyone (which I have done tons of times lol)....keep up the good work all you guys there!! I am a happy customer who will always return!!!
The food is as authentic as it gets!  Service was speedy.  Servers were nice.  Did not try any of the spicy foods so I didn't exactly get to evaluate the authenticity of what true Sichuanese spice is all about, but I did get a taste of the numbing peppers, so I think we're on the right track.
I didn't feel any remorse from the staff as if this was a common occurrence and part of the service. So the service has returned to the typical Chinese style. Not a big deal. I took one star away as if they were like other Chinese restaurants. There was nothing special about this place anymore.
One thing of note is that the prices are slightly higher than most Chinese places in Madison, but I'd say it's well worth it.
They were just recognized as one of the top 100 Asian restaurants in the U.S. Definitely check this one out!
Diner style, great menu, lots of variety.  Helpful waitress.  Food was great!  I nice break and just one block from the Strip!
-i had their chinese sausage fried rice- delicious
Mini Wontons = Wonton wrapper. -_________- wtc. All this craziness. I literally had doughy wrapper in soup for lunch. I mean their soup is light and flavorful but it tasted like misc. powder made soup. It was also extremely salty.
I won't be going back.  Its a real shame too since the location is ideal for me....
New York Chinese is awesome.. My boyfriend and I won't eat Chinese any where else. The takeout menu comes with soup, which are all delicious. And their portions are large, especially for the price!
you definitely get what you pay for here.
This place has authentic Szechwan cuisine.  People who are used to pseudo-Szechwan cuisine from other restaurants will find some differences.  Be sure to try their Water Boiled Fish Filet with Chili pepers.  This dish comes in a bowl (as it looks more like a soup) and is topped with cilantro.  I tried it for lunch and will definately return for dinner.  They don't have alcohol yet but have applied for their permit.
There are several dishes to choose from...................................
I ordered several suggestions from yelp, but something is missing. It was good- maybe I just don't like Chinese food? Nothing spectacular. Minimum delivery price of $15 keep that in mind. 
Service meets standard. The place looks clean and modern which is no surprise because it is located in the Venetian :)
Prices are slightly (okay not slightly, most defintely incredibly) inflated - well compared to NYC Chinese food prices. However it was welcoming to be able to find comfort food nearby.
the food: gross... i mean seriously. they make only one type of noodle here and there is no way to have it any other way then the way it is on the menu. the portions are pretty small, so if you like noodles its going to suck for you, I love noodles and it was quite sad for me. the hainan chicken rice was decent. the dim sum shrimp "har gow" was good and very shrimpy. but for 9 bucks you better hope so.  the soy milk was okay a little bland, the watermelon juice was good. o the vietnamese coffee, dont get it. its not good at all... 
One thing to note is that they do not have a soda fountain, so sodas ($1.75, Pepsi products) are sold by the can.
Service was uneven as usual but it's a Chinese restaurant so I expect such.
I had the Cumin Lamb.  Very tasty with a nice spice.  Was very rich in flavor which filled me very quickly.  Again, the pancakes when nicely with this dish.  
I decided to see if I could find Asian food for delivery.  Extra points if I could order online.
Owners Lon and Wong are super (and always there, which makes it consistent). Ambiance and winter heating are lacking, but the food is always hot and good. A jewel of a place in a town with few decent Chinese restuarants....
You know there is a little Vietnamese joint down the road called Nam Sao.  You wont find better customer service, they'll treat you like family and they are proud of their food.  The sad thing is in this economy they are struggling.  Thats sad to see when places like pong pong are willing to throw customer's (that actually like their food) away like trash.  I guess in this economy pong pong can afford to lose customers.
This place is really close to my house... so when we don't want to cook... we get take-out.
Gross. Greasy. White chicken meat did NOT even taste like white meat. Mongolian Beef (?) was that actually real beef?? Veggies were even disgusting. Rice was crunchy and resembled maggots. None of us (4) could tolerate any of the meals we chose we threw it all away!!! Never again. Even if it were free AND the only food left on earth!!!
For the first course, I went with the stir fried spicy quail with fresh lily bulb.  The dish was prepared with Chinese 5 spice and chili sauce.  It had a really nice tang but it was not overpowering, just very good!  There were two legs and 2 wings--a very ample serving for a starter.
Pretty unhappy, we called and they guy on the phone said we didn't order the meals, but only the individual servings.  Are you kidding??   I didn't think this was Panda Express.  They delivered and while we wanted them to do that, I decided I just didn't want to deal with them again.
This location was very clean service was good and Orange Chicken is still the bomb.
Preatty good we go between games or whenever we tired of out schedule and no willing to cook it's always good service
A Great place to grab good Chinese food.... Try the Mongolian beef it's spicy but it hits the spot
The staff was nice and attentive, and even put our leftovers away for us.  
I hope you enjoy this place as much as I did!
BBQ Pork Rice Plate - their bbq pork here is juicy and perfect. Comes with rice, and steamed veggies. 
We all win.
I miss the Mandarin Chicken but they have the new Teriyaki which is ok.
I am going to start dumping all my garbage on your front door, because that's what you keep doing to me and the entire neighborhood!
The food was really good. Very flavorful. We had asked for an order of Crab Angels (crab ragoon) but never received them. But all in all it was good food. Don't know if I would make a special trip or anything to go back. But if you are in the area and nothing else seems good, like KFC, Pizzahut, Tacobell this would be the better choice.
  My past visit to their Lake Mead Boulevard location left me with an exceptional first impression of New York Chinese Restaurant. When I write exceptional first impression, I am saying that it is my contemporary favorite Chinese restaurant in the Vegas valley. With that in mind, when I hiked in Red Rock Canyon this past Saturday, I planned it so that I would try their Fort Apache location on my drive back to Henderson.   
Price was ok for what we ordered off the dinner menu and we did leave with leftovers.
Great new restaurant. Posh decor and a crowded dining room and patio with good looking people for dinner on a Wednesday night. 
Overall Ichiban is good.
We'll have to go some other non-holiday weekend to see how the service is.
One of the pictures on this got my attention and I wanted to try the Szechwan Beef. 
 mon - thurs $ 10,99 ,  week end $ 12,99 for dinner. for lunch $ 7,99.
Firstly, there was quite a bit of choices in their lunch specials that ranged from $4.95-$6.95- what a deal for quality food! 
i guess that's the cons of having an open kitchen...the customers get to see the good, the bad and the ugly.
Why did some tables get orange slices at the end of their meal and we only got fortune cookies?
Happy to have found great Chinese Delivery from Bamboo China. Tried and really enjoyed Mongolian Lamb, Eggplant and garlic, Mu Shu Pork and the Mandarin Scallops! Fast and HOT delivery too. :) Now my first call...
This little hole in the wall is not really a hole in the wall when you step inside. The dining room is huge and always packed with customers. Tables of 4 and 9 dominate the scene with an army of waiters constantly bringing out freshly prepared authentic Chinese Cuisine. My personal favorite is the Whole Crispy Garlic Chicken. It is chopped to perfection and served with fresh blanched scallions (my mouth is watering as I write this review). Yet another lesson learned by "don't judge a book by its cover."
I brought a co worker in for lunch before driving back to So Cal. The place was dead BC of a fatal car accident which closed off access from North Decatur.
Great pictures of old Las Vegas in the hallway to Sonny's bar. Check them out if your there. 
This place rocks! I am very happy to have a local place that we all like. The staff are super sweet and helpful. The service is really great and reliable. Everything is clean and comfortable. They are very helpful from the seating to special requests.
We had a lunch special with soup, egg roll, sweet and sour pork, moo goo gai pan fried rice plus a serving of beef chow mein.  As the web page also states, most items are prepared fresh.  My hot and sour soup was different than some hot/sour soups I've tasted, a little thicker, SIng High's personal recipe.  More a small burrito than an egg or spring roll, the egg roll was delivered too steaming hot to eat immediately.  The pork was also freshly prepared, my thinking back, my count is 9 unusually large pieces.  The fried rice was white rice cooked well, fired with soy sauce and a bit of veggies.  The plate of noodles was large and flavors good.  
i may have found a new favorite chinese food spot, but why does it have to be in mesa? and why aren't there any amazingly great chinese food places in north phoenix?
The chef offered us dessert of tapioca in chilled coconut milk. It was a nice light end to the meal,and he said it was for friends only. Awww we're friends!
The soup with noodles was to die for, it's not PHO people (other yelpers have confused it) it's Chinese soup and they pulled off the broth perfectly. The Stir-fried noodles had a wee bit too much Sesame oil IMHO but they were still very yummy.
Love this place. Food is good, prices are good, and it's close to where I live. We eat here a couple times a month and have never been disappointed. The carry-out is always ready when I get there and I live 5 minutes away.
 
Blink and you could miss this treat. HK Yum Yum is a Chinese restaurant and takeaway, offering a great range of dishes. I first tried HK Yum Yum when a friend recommended it to me. My immediate impression was not one of amazement but I'm glad I trusted that friend!
The rice and steamed vegetables were good, but that's about all we could tolerate. We ordered General Tso's, which is what we always get when we first try a Chinese restaurant. It helps us compare to other places.The quality of the chicken used was awful. The dumplings were flavorless. We will not be returning.
And what is it supposed to be?  Asian fast food, dine-in / take-out.
A new place (Hong Kong Asian Cuisine) opened up down the road and it's unfortunately charging the same prices with almost the same menu.
This place is legit.   It's probably one of the few noodles houses in the Phoenix-area, unlike the myriad in California (which I so dearly miss).  I'm glad to see that the varieties of food are diversifying more and more now.
THE ONLY really good thing I ate there were their fried turnip cakes with taro. these hold a wow factor that nothing else on the menu can bring!
I once walked into this location and had a man yell at me because I said the name, "China Joe", he thought I was being racist because a chinese guy had to be named joe. 
The food is good - as American Chinese goes. But don't confuse it with real Chinese food. The ambience is a step above a traditional Chinese place. And the service is very good.
The wonton soup and fried rice were pretty good also, and so was this spicy noodle dish, which I forget at the moment exactly what it was called.  
The eggroll and wonton were not overly breaded, and the crispiness had a nice crunch that did not get messy. I chose the orange chicken for my entree and it hit the spot. The flavor from the sauce was right on, and it was evenly deep fried to provide a subtle crunch that did not take away from the chicken.
For the inedible dish and expensive soup, it was over $18.  Imagine if each person got a dish, yikes!  There is no value for your money.  Just lots and lots of styrofoam...! Will not return!
I am a 2x a month delivery order who tries different things and I can say I've enjoyed 90% of what I have eaten. My favs are the hot and sour soup, dragon balls, and the house chow mein.
Just got done with delivery.
We used to go there fairly often, but like everyone else has said THE SERVICE has gotten horrible. We were going to use the 15% off valpak coupon until we saw right on the coupon in bold red print HAPPY TUESDAY ALL DAY 25% OFF, so it was tues so we left the 15% coupon home. when we got there, ordered app., when it came out I asked him about the 25% off all day, he said that was a "mis-print" so we ate the app & decided we would still order food, except that it took him FOREVER to come back, by that time i said just give me a check. When i want to pay the mustached chic I asked her since we left our cpn at home since today was supposed to be 25% off day if we could still get the 15% off? she went in back, then came back out and said they would have to have the coupon.
Which is a shame, because the folks at Chop Chop Wok ARE friendly. They provide stellar customer service. It's just that once you get your coveted, white-paper takeout boxes home and dive inside you realize you'd have gotten closer to great Chinese takeout had you just gone to middle America's favorite, P.F. Chang's. 
the chicken chow mein= amazing
Wonton soup, house chow fun, and singapore noodles.  My favorites on the menu.
The shrimp was perfectly cooked in the lo-mein, the crab puffs were crispy and they didn't scrimp on the cream cheese inside, plenty of sauce to go around.  
We walked in around 4:30pm on Friday and were seated quickly.  The place isn't very large and it's decorated simply but nicely.  We were pleasantly surprised to hear that it was Happy Hour.  Everyday from 3-7pm all alcohol and all appetizers are half off.  What a deal!  I even heard the waiter for the table behind us telling them that many people come in for happy hour and just order an assortment of appetizers.  Sounds like a great plan for some other time, but we were pretty hungry.
Can't wait to visit again!
Also, because we would like noodles and rice. 
 Ask for chili/hot sauce if you want it spicier.  They have bottled hot sauce and a paste, that I love, but it's not hot.   Real Chinese is NOT spicy hot.  Szechuan is spicier.   If you want tons of spice, go elsewhere.
I will NEVER go there again.  I reserved a table for a group of 16 people for 5:00 PM on Christmas Eve .  The person on the phone ( I believe the manager) repeatedly asked me to call ahead and give him an accurate head count since he said they'd be swamped that day.  I followed up with him twice.  
I agree that the decor is straight out of the 60s, and this is the kind of Chinese food that I learned to like when I was 20--that's a lot of years ago.  Good stuff.
They're super fast with takeout too - I called during the week recently and it was ready in 10 minutes.
The food is decent.  Not bad not great. The service is poor. The teenagers at the front were brats and rolled her eyes when i made a simple request. I ordered a chicken dish and substituted the meat for tofu and they charged me $2+ Really?! Tofu is cheaper! This place is only close to my house. That's why I ate here. I've given this place a few shots but It's not good.
BTW, what is it with Chinese places and duck sauce? They seem to act as if they have never heard of it, every time. Although it says 'duck sauce' right on it. If you only get it when you order duck, fine. Tell me that, I can accept limitations. Its just when there is a blank stare or, even better, a "We don't have that" (when I can clearly see it) that annoys me.
We were a bit confused with the Japanese decor.
Only thing I have to complain about is the bathrooms.  You have to exit the building.  The bathrooms are not airconditioned, in the summer in AZ that can be quite hot!
This place is decent. I enjoyed the shrimp tempura roll. I think the sesame chicken is way too sweet. I do go from time to time, but not too often.
Thought this place was pretty good but I have had better.  My friend ordered the brisket noodle dish and felt that all the meat was fatty and didn't it any of if.  However, the broth and noodles were tasty.  I did enjoy the steamed shrimp dumplings...they were very good.
Well it was OK not horrible not great just OK! 
Regardless, try the crab angels with the beef with peppers.
Don't get me started on the General Tso's Chicken (soggy, drenched in sauce)....Cashew Chicken (also fishy) and even those things so simple, like deep frying the Crab Rangoon and Egg Rolls were a huge MISS! The oil (which they said was changed daily, I highly doubt, even the best restaurants with the highest table turns don't change it but once a week!)....the oil was changed daily but the food told me otherwise: dark brown in color....no better than Panda Express if you ask me.
This place only gets one star because the system will not let me post the comment without any stars. 
Just average Chinese food. The Hunan beef was pretty good, but there was nothing special about anything else. The hot and sour soup had a strange taste. I didn't know the portions are family style and I ended up ordering way too much food. I will try somewhere else before ordering from them again.
I completely forgot about my experience 2 years ago and went back to eat  again...
It's my number 1 for Chinese take-out in Edinburgh. More please!
I can still remember being at ASU more than a decade ago, and laughing late at night every time I saw a commercial for Flo's.  No matter what I was watching, somewhere between midnight and 3:00am it would air at least once.  A cheap, but somehow overly produced ad featuring an asian woman with a heavy accent introducing herself, and explaining why I should eat at her restaurant.  Yes, it's quite immature, but it led to a friend of mine and I becoming obsessed with trying Flo's on general principal.  And when we finally did, we were surprised to become big fans.
The portions are big. You really get a lot of food for the price. I'm a big eater and I didn't come close to finishing everything. Fortunately, that just means leftovers :)
There's really not that much to say about this place. The food's nice, athough it's not exactly going to win any Michelin Stars any time soon, and likewise the service and prices fall into a similar category - good enough to deserve a visit here but not good enough to rave about.
Ordered sweet and sour chicken to carry out and asked if the sauce could be put on the side, was told yes. When picking up the order was charged and extra $1.50 for putting the sauce on the side. When asked why they hadn't said anything before she said "it's only a dollar!" Actually it's $1.50 plus tax.  Wish I had just left the food there and walked out.  Customer service is not present at this restaurant and $14 for one order of just ok sweet and sour chicken is way too much.  I will not return and would not recommend Dragon Wok to anyone.
Now, surely this defeats the point of going out for a meal, but it's actually a great concept.  It's a lot easier than it sounds and you just stick in whatever you think might work (they offer recommendations)  and then eat it when you think it's ready.  I went for chicken with lemongrass, chilli and coriander which was actually really tasty and didn't take as long as I expected for it to cook.  
My girlfriend took me to this little spot when I wanted to go to China a Go Go.  She told me I needed to try the lunch special here.  Well, like most things, she was right.  This place is the bomb.  Cheap lunches a tons of food!  Although it is your standard Americanized lunch fare, the food tasted better and the plate filled me up.  If you're in the area, check this place out.  You won't be disappointing.  
Moderately priced, great taste, and quick service. My favorite for Chinese food. When I want good French food I look where the French go to eat... this is where a lot of Chinese people eat. End of search.
1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISHMENT!
Eat here once or twice a week since 2008 Jan. Love their Szechuan Shrimp, House fried rice and Mongolian beef. Try it and you will love it. Dont forget their $5 dollar lunch specials...
Since I was a child, Wor Wonton Soup has been a requirement any time I am not feeling well. The other night I had the flu, and being new to the area I was stuck without a favorite Chinese food destination.
Beef Chow Funn with Black Bean Sauce
- Great dessert menu - reminded me of all those wonderful dessert spots in China I miss so much (lots of black rice, shaved ice, custards, etc).
oh yeah... the rice is jasmine rice which i am not a fan of... i like my rice sticky... you can order brown rice as well...
I also ordered another great dish, Smooth beef with egg over rice. Their beef was perfectly fluffy ( I can tell they use the Baking Soda to soften up the meat first as the texture of it is very uniquely soft) and the thick white sauce with egg white was the perfect mixture over the rice. This dish was cheap, only $6 for such a large dish. 
My wife and I found this place on Yelp a few months back. We have ordered delivery many times and the food is always wonderful, delivery is quick, and the prices are very fair. Recently they delivered the wrong item. I called in and they offered to send the correct item or they would give me a credit towards the next order. Perfect.  We called in tonight and they gave us our credit and delivered our food. One again, the order was not correct. This time when I called I was told that the missing item was never ordered. I found this strange because when the order was repeated back to me the missing item WAS on the order.  No offer was made to correct this mistake. The person on the phone was a bit rude and I told them to just forget it.  We will not order delivery again. The ONLY reason I give them 2 stars is because the food is FANTASTIC!
The new website is www.chinachinamesa.com!!
Nice looking place inside and out. 
Thankfully the food tasted good.  So they regained a star with that.  I am not sure if we will try this location again after the long wait...  even though the food was pretty tasty.
My bf and I moved here from the East coast where we've had amazing Chinese food.  Being Chinese, my bf was craving authentic Chinese food.  Based on the yelp reviews, we chose to go here, NEVER again, we got food poisoning from here just from the fried rice!
Holy moly.... Do not order any Vietnamese pho from here. It was disgusting!! Tasted like a boullion cube was dropped in the tasteless broth. I ordered summer rolls that deserve to be in the hall of shame. I took one sip of the broth and immediately told the server it was nasty. He looked at me and said most people use hoisin sauce to season it.. Wtf!! No offer to exchange or anything! Stick to Chinese food please, according to these other positive reviews!! I will never come here again. I feel robbed!!
Even my dog wouldnt eat there... but since he's missing a leg, he might need to steer clear of this place before they try to stew him up. BTW I AM ASIAN so keep the racist accusations to yourselves, white weirdos. 
We ordered the following: West Lake soup, honey walnut prawns, beef chow fun (dry), sesame chicken, mongolian beef, house fried rice, garlic green beans with tofu and Peking pork chop.  Our favorite restaurant is Hong Kong Dining on  24th St and Indian School, but China Chili has some dishes that surpass them.  The West Lake soup was good, not too thick with good flavor.  I thought the garlic green beans were top notch, as were the honey walnut prawns.  Those three dishes I would come back for any day.
Where am I going with this? I know battered and fried chunks of meat are probably really bad for you, but I am tempted to try China One's version, AND they actually offer an all white-meat General Tso's option ($1 extra charge, according to their cashier.) The odds are good that their GTC is great. Just haven't had the courage to 'abandon' the Chicken w/Hot Garlic Sauce yet!
I eat semi regularly at Noodle Asia in the Venetian. Regretfully, they don't understand customer service. They create many good food dishes here but the Wonton soup is lacking in one thing. Fish sauce.
Kung pao chicken
* Spicy eggplant
This place is pumping out some excellent Chinese cuisine.
This place is awesome!  I have eaten at lots of Chinese places and this place is great and reasonable.
Oh man, this place is a gem! The people are friendly and the food blows any other place I have been to out of the water! The portions are huge, but the bill won't be, if you are in the area, I recommend this place hands down!
I can tell that it is a family run place. The kids do the front and wait service. The older folks do the cooking in back.
The food, in a word, was just spectacular. We had the Crab Wontons and the Vegetable Spring Rolls to start. Both had interesting and appropriate dipping sauces We always eat Family Style so we shared the Mongolian Beef, Shrimp in Lobster Sauce, Soft Noodle/Fried Egg and the Kung Pao Shrimp. I wasn't sure about the Soft Noodle/Fried Egg because it just seemed strange, but it was absolutely heavenly. Everything was perfectly made. The shrimp seemed to snap when you bite into them. The Kung Pao was spicy without being overpowering.  The Shrimp in Lobster Sauce was decadent. The Mongolian Beef was tender and perfectly seasoned. Everything just tasted FRESH. Clearly the ingredients hadn't been sitting around and nothing had been premade or had sat under a heat lamp. Everything was nicely seasoned with a nice mixture of flavors without being overpowering.
I am a real fan of Pho and there are quite a few option in this area. I have seen this place next to LeeLee's for a while but never thought anything of it. The other night I needed something just for myself so i figured I would go in for a to-go order.
so first i called the other place, pei wok. the line was busy. i waited, and tried again. BUSY. well, too bad pei wok, you're the big loser tonight. the winner by default was great wok. they answered on the first ring, and the kid that answered the phone was nice. they didn't have a menu online anywhere, so he proceeded to go through their menu items with me one by one. 
A few minutes later, they brought out another orange chicken and the water boiled fish.  The chicken was hot (this time) and crispy, but the sauce was overly sweet.  Pretty average although the portion was more than generous.
Very decent take-out style chinese.  I got the New York Style Chow Mein which, to my surprise, had no noodles.  Maybe they misheard me when I called in my order and I got chop suey, because that is what it seemed like.
The owner explained how in his eighteen years in the business, he got his first fake twenties recently which means the FBI is probably now watching the place.
Two Words... Noodle Bowls.
Yuck! Everything I ordered tasted gross :( I've been here often years before and this was my first time back in over 2 years. I didn't complain. I sucked it up, paid the bill and will never be back. Only good thing about the place- cheap beer.
An old favorite.
I am a native New Yorker where the best Chinese food exists in almost every corner.  There is no such thing as bad Chinese food in NY.  I tried the chinese food here and it is EXCELLENT.  Had the egg drop soup and the won ton soup.  The wonton soup was off the charts. Wonderful flavorful broth with a truly meaty wonton with very light dough.  Amazing.
 We got a great table in front of the windows to watch the water show up close while the music played quietly overhead.  It was romantic!
If I had liked the dish, I would say it was very under-portioned compared to what you are used to getting at Chinese restaurants. At the end of my meal, I had such a horrible taste in my mouth, I just wanted to leave as soon as possible, chew gum, brush my teeth, or purge myself.  It was that bad. 
In all I had a good meal, my dining companions and I were treated to great service and good, solid Chinese cuisine. Once Woo's gets through it's opening pains and adjusts a few minor things, it'll be a solid choice for the Old Town lunch crowd, a dinner destination and a definite social hot spot.
Ate there tonight. Don't love chinese but they have thai stuff. Can't say I loved the foodt. But its very clean. Food is very fresh. And you get the impression that they do their thing with more care than most places. If you like chinese you should be very happy.
--- The Bottom Line: 
Last time I tried the Schezwan Shrimp.  It was good, but not spicy enough for my taste.
We dine at Fin restaurant in Mirage and the food was very tasty, flavorful and fulfilling. We ordered the scallop fried rice (the best), steamed fish, sea bass (so juicy), shark fin soup, duck, Chinese broccoli, steamed chicken, and my favorite the foie gras... oh so good. After we were done with our main course, they brought out their sweet pudding dessert and oranges. 
There was no one in the restaurant. the place was a graveyard, yet no one thought it was important to wipe the tables or even sweep the floor. Crumbs and sticky stains everywhere. i ordered take-out before I got a good look at the place. While I waited for my order I looked around for a place to sit - no clean chairs. All had crumbs on them. Tables had folded-up pieces of cardboard shoved underneath the legs, balancing them out. One table had THREE cardboard balancers. All the chairs have chipped paint. There are stacks of sodas with a stained apron tossed onto the top of them - better wipe those bitches down good before you slurp, people!! The license on the wall reads 2008. HOLY GOD THIS IS 2010!
The dining room has always been quite clean, maybe made to feel moreso with the metal tables (they look like polished aluminum or stainless steel, very modern looking), and there is some decent art hanging on the walls.  The restrooms are situated such that you can see into the kitchen area if you head over to them, which to me says that the owner has some pride in the cleanliness there as well.
Lamb skewers are THE thing to get here. The lamb is very tender and fatty. They then pile on authentic spices which covers up the gamey taste. This is pretty much as close as you can get to authentic chinese lamb skewers in Vegas so definitely try this. 5 pieces for $6.
This place is amazing!!  Please be sure to join the Warrior program to get 10% off on all meals.  The service is great and the food is delicious.  I go there often and have never had a bad experience.  The manager also comes around and checks on the service.
On top of my head: war won ton soup, salt n pepper shrimps, salt n pepper cod, salt n pepper calamari, salt n pepper pork shops, seafood n tofu claypot, chinese brocolis, mustard greens, shrimp fried rice, roast duck, filet mignon cube, mongolian beef, sea bass with black bean sauce and much more than what I cant recall at this time!
That's about it.  It's basically an upper scale PF Chang's with Panda Express food.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoy me some Panda Express from time to time, but I pay Panda Express money.  If I'm forking this amount cash in this place, the food better have been dummy-waitered from the city of Shanghai.  I want to be able to taste the sweat that dripped off the cooks forehead from Shanghai in my dish.  Not really, but you know what I mean.  I don't think I was even full after the meal.
Thanksgiving trip to Vegas, we didn't check in to the Monte Carlo until almost one in the morning and I was practically asleep, but I knew I needed to catch a second wind. I headed to the casino, ordered a Bloody Mary, then went to go find food. The pizza looked old, I didn't want McDonalds, Rubios Fish Tacos did not sound appetizing at 1:00 AM, and the chicken place was closed...Chinese it is!
Ended up eating here last Saturday after some steak place said they had a 20 minute wait. I was delirious with hunger and probably had real low blood sugar. My wife and I ordered eggrolls, I inhaled 3 of them. 
Visited at lunch and as I was seated, the waitress immediately brought over a small teapot of oolong.  It was warm and perfect for a rainy day, and I don't know any Chinese places that do this any more!  I ordered the Sweet/Sour Shrimp lunch entree (only $6.25!), and upgraded my soup for an extra .50 to Hot & Sour.  
- Large selection of lunch specials
I ordered a Wonton Soup and a White Rice. Pretty simple, walked in expecting to pay 5, maybe 6, at most 7 dollars. Final Bill was 9.70!! For, that's right folks, white rice and wonton soup.
Beef chow fun - "We out of rice noodle?  Try our pan fried noodle!"
Ok, so it isn't the edgiest, most high fashion establishment to elegantly eat your noodles (who I am kidding, there's nothing elegant about my chopstick technique), but what it doesn't have necessarily in the trends department, it makes up for with a consistently high standard of food and very professional staff.
red 8, ive been my first time about 2 years ago with a group of family and the food was excellent a bit pricey but very good but thats vegas for ya, the beef was mouth melting and most fusion places and chinese places the beef is chewy but not this one i enjoyed every piece and so did my family, they usually have a long wait so get there early an put your name down if you are in vegas you must try!
This was... not good.
If you live on campus, you should definitely check this place out. 
daughters were not. That is totally unacceptable, and it is not like we were there for an extended period of time (around 20 minutes). To take my 2 year olds lunch without asking when we are spending $25 at your establishment is not acceptable.
The only problem we had was when we used the Yelp coupon ($30 for $20). We ordered an appetizer during happy hour (which was half off, because of happy hour) and they told us because we used the coupon from Yelp we shouldn't have received half off on the appetizer. I don't know if they are telling us we shouldn't have ordered it or what, but we showed them our $30 for $20 coupon when we ordered. They didn't have to give us half off. Overall though, it is good food and I would recommend it to anyone looking to fulfill your chinese food craving!
The wings were dry but acceptable. Nothing to return for.
Wow .... Wthell ... How is this even in the Wynn?
we got a pair of rolls that were $5 each at happy hour consisting of 4 pieces each... and a plate of edamame for $5...
Food is ok, price is ok. nothing special.
Kwok may not be the classiest of Chinese restaurants, but its specials board in particular reflects the quality of the experience you can have in here.  The service is friendly and the food, although not speedy to reach you, doesn't take too long to arrive.  The menu is extensive, but I would certainly advise looking at the specials for something unusual to try.  I went for a white fish stew which was served in a delicious oyster sauce and their tasty special fried rice.  
We decided to order pork fried rice, beef with snow peas and moo shoo chicken along with the complimentary tea and white rice. All dishes were fresh, hot and served to us within 10 minutes of our order. We had plenty of food left over and gave me another meal today.
This is a neat place. The ambiance is quirky and fun, and being able to watch the chefs make the noodles from scratch is a nice touch. 
My last fortune cookie said I'll probably return to Chin's. It's on the way home from work, the food comes out fast and I can't resist those damn cream cheese wontons. Maybe I'll throw in some potstickers or wraps and call it dinner.
Kinda' sorta' made a mistake.  The location is open but they now have a new name, new owners, new menu, and (get this) a new phone number.  Changing the phone number IMO was a big mistake, just think of all the business they're missing.  It's not like they became a dry cleaners or gas station.  Anyway...
This is very authentic food. I love different ethnic food and honestly their menu was still a little too authentic for me - and from what I got not healthy and not all that good. I ordered a chicken lemongrass bowl. The chicken was in a lot of oil - all over the chicken - with a plentiful layer at the bottom of the bowl.
The Crab Rangoon's are to die for!
Since last Saturday I have the bowl of chic curry seated on my refrigerator. It was the worse curry i ever tried. I order delivery at 10:50am it arrived at 11:40am PS: IT is 5 min from my house, but bc of personal reasons I could not go there. House fried rice/fried chic wings and red curry...The only good thing of all was the wings, everything else I couldn't eat. The rice was undercooked, and the curry tasted terrible.
We were quickly seated and ordered the Chinese broccoli in oyster sauce ($10) and the spicy ying nan rice noodles ($14) and the service was very quick. The portions were decent and it wasn't as greasy compared to the true Chinese restaurants back home. The spiciness on the soup was fair and the Chinese broccoli was steamed just right where it still had a crunch. 
Egg Drop and Wonton Soup wife Loved it
Finally, the House Fried Rice was the only dish that actually had some flavor to speak of. The aroma and color of the entree was appetizing. But, there was maybe 3 small shrimp, some chicken and pork and plenty of veggies. The portion was large so for almost $10 you get enough fried rice for maybe a couple of meals. 
The staff was extremely nice and the food was great. From first impression it looks like a whole in the wall but don't let that detour to from trying the amazing food.
Doesn't look like much from the outside but inside are table clothed tables.  Prices are reasonable.  Service is excellent.
The filling of the wontons was good with a blend of pork and shrimp, but the wrappers seemed overcooked/too soggy. For me the noodles seemed on the thin side for a proper wonton noodle soup (and therefore came out on the post al-dente side), but I did appreciate that the noodles are made in house. 
Chicken Lo Mein
WreckX'N Effect's Rump Shaker incorporated into a Yelp review?  Challenge accepted!
We have yet to have a bad meal hear and we have tried many dishes.  The portions are huge and everything is cooked to order quickly and it is so yummy.  
I really liked this place. Am I just strange? Compared to the reviewers below, I was impressed by the noodles at this spot. It was one of those colder days that a warm bowl of soup just sounded great. Well, everyone else went for the soup; I went for the zha jiang mian.
BTW, I've been to China, where the food is fantastic, and this is not far off that experience.  GO to Amlee, choose for yourself!
chefs intermezzo- a shot glass with champagne with a blob of strawberry sorbet -amazing  5 stars
Try the Double Dragon. It was perfectly cooked -- and just melted in my mouth.
Cumin Lamb- tiny fatty lamb pieces stir fried with chile, cumin, onions and red bell peppers.  Nice dish, but we probably would have been better off just getting lamb skewers since the flavor profile is pretty similar.
Mr Jung must get tired of seeing me show up at his establishment but it really cannot be helped.  Ever since I found it, I cannot keep myself from thinking about some of the best Orange Shrimp, Singapore Noodles, and Hong Kong Noodles anywhere!  Is it really possible that this establishment within a stones throw of Pei Wei can hold its own and then some?!  I think this place is economical, and it freshly prepares most main entrees.  I might have to round up a few more people tonight and go for dinner.  I just wish we had Mr. Jung open up something here in the Copa!  To be clear...as soon as I can have a few more carbs, they will totally be spent over a plate at Totts!
A good spot for a quick bite to eat. The portions on the meal are much larger then the rice bowl. Quick, satisfying and clean!
I personally love coming to this place. The staff is extremely nice and easy going and the food is very good!
Yummy actual chinese food. The food was good and even authentic. They also have a variety of non-Chinese cuisine. The fried rice with the salted fish was excellent. The waitress, seeing I am not at all Asian, asked if I was sure I wanted it with the salted fish. An acquired taste usually common to those who are accustomed to that cuisine. Of course I wanted it! And it made all the difference. I also had the wonton soup. You can actually see the ingredients inside the wonton, and it has big chunks of real shrimp. They also senve French coffee with sweetened condensed milk. I am accustomed to this being called Thai coffee, and it was great. I hate it when places put so much sweetened condensed milk that the sugariness puckers your mouth after the first sip. This was just right! Give this place a try!
Every time I try another place, I wish I would have gone to Gourmet Wok. Like, today I went to Quick Wok on Mill & Southern, not again. Don't get me wrong, the food was great, but less of it and $2 more. 
Within an hour, my husband was feeling ill. H didn't start violently vomiting until 1am and that was an every 30minute to one hour ordeal until 10am. He can't even hold down water at this point.
-  Hot and sour soup for 2, may have been the best part of our lunch, good, but didn't pack a punch on either spicy or sour.
I don't know what happened. 
Asian Cafe Express is our absolute favorite go-to place for cheap, delicious chinese food.  We have brought several groups of friends there, and they have become returning customers as well.  We love the lo mein, orange chicken, and mongollian beef.
I thought Chin Chin was great.  After a weekend of all sorts of pub/bar food and Italian type fare, this sounded so good.
I have had several menu items.  My choice yesterday was Orange Chicken.  It is not one of the lunch specials so I got a full dinner combo ($6.15, see picture).  It was way more food than I could finish.  In fact all but the smallest of the lunch specials is usually too much for me.  One of my favorites is House Chicken.  The fried rice is dry on a good day and almost inedibly crunchy on a bad day.
Pros:  Affordable and pretty good quality.  
The boy and I had dinner here last Wednesday night. I had only ever had take out from here, but have heard rave reviews so we decided to check it out. It's easy to miss, being located in a seedy strip mall next to a poker/strip club type bar?? We were the only ones in the restaurant, the entire hour or so we were there. So I am going to assume it's quiet on the weeknights? 
Highlights:
Mongolian Beef - C+
Sausage Fried Rice: We ordered this just to accompany the other dishes. It was pretty pricey for what it is, but at least it wasn't bad.
-Crab Puffs 
Food:
- Generous portions. Cause we're hungry people! Or we just love leftovers.
This far exceeds the other chinese place I had to eat a while back....
Not as good as China a go go I usually go to but still ok. green valley location is the best!!!!
This is a great alternative to the sit down chinese. It has strong hints of NY in the flavors. The sauces are very balanced, and less garlic-y than the other options in Scottsdale. The vegetables are fresh and fantastically prepared. The price is about $2 cheaper across the board than its competitors.  If you can appreciate NY Chinese food, and more specifically Chinese from Queens, then this is the place for you.
- small portion for the price. few meat for their combo
Service amazing 
My husband and I go to the counter to order.  It's one of those places where you order your food first then sit.  We chose the lo mein, cashew shrimp,  Mongolian beef, fried rice and beef egg foo young.  We got free cheese crab won ton for spending over $20.  
Located in the deep hood on the southside, near the corner of 7th street & Roser in between a liquor store and a recreation center infront of the high school that still holds the record of most student sponsored riots and most confiscated guns in the Nation. Nestled in the crossroads of three of the largest gang's territory in the state, Wong's To Go has been a firm establishment in what can be a very chaotic environment. I personally love the southside... it's tension, it's colorful characters and colorless buildings are beautiful to me.
Maybe there's better delivery Chinese food in Madison but I won't be searching for it anytime soon; I'm happy with Orient House.
Then came the food. Bleh. I saw a review saying that "this is your grandfather's chinese place" and that couldn't be more right. It was like buffet style food in a restaraunt setting. Everything was overcooked and slimy, the bamboo shoots were clear and weird, the sprouts smelled a little strange. The crab puffs had NO crab in them, weren't really all that puffy, and contained the sick moist  nothing-but-cream-cheese filling I've learned to hate over the years. You can't really eat them without the cakey dough like texture getting all in your mouth and tainting your next bite.
The BBQ tasted pretty good, but had quite a bit of fat/gristle on my pieces. Not a fan of that. I had to nibble around the fat pieces. 
If you want a good, fast Chinese food experience, eat here.
this place is good as hell and it is in the main chinatown mall! it is actually inside the mall!!!! its a little closed off section in the middle. super good and super cheep.
For those that are accustomed to a lower price point for similar food back home, they will most likely get a nice wake up call since the price point for the menu here is significantly higher (again you have to grasp the realization that you're dining at a casino). We ordered  the wonton, egg noodle soup; beef stew noodles; and the xiao long baos (soup dumplings). The wontons were suprisingly flavorful, the xiao long baos were decent although the texture of the dumpling skin was on the soggy side, and the beef stew would probably be the best dish we had. But for obvious reasons it's not food that I would wait on line for or anything.
Read other reviews and given it's right around the corner from work, an associate and I had to check in out. We had fried dumplings for the appetizer (excellent) but no soy sauce was offered or on the table. I equated this to asking for A-1 at a great steak house. For the entree I had sweet and sour pork, my friend had lemon chicken and we shared a shrimp fried rice. Everything was excellent. Crispy cover on the pork and chicken and great sauce on both dishes. I'd love to come here with a big group and taste test the Poo Poo platter. Lunch prices are very reasonable. You'll have to ask for soy sauce and silverware. Or just sharpen one of your chop sticks and go harpooning. Enjoy.
Honey Chicken. good 
Crispy Duck Salad - unexpalainable.  You have to order it to get it.
Don't be put off, try this lovely little restaurant which despite appearances is a cut above the rest.
This is a fairly large place, & nice inside.  It had a couple of TVs playing, but not too loudly, as a moderate crowd joined me for dining on about 55 trays of food at lunchtime.  The hot & sour soup was neither, & while some of the hot food items were good, a lot of it was too oily for my taste.  There were several shrimp dishes, which was nice, & the service was friendly & attentive, but the price was a little high at $7.45 for lunch.
Honestly, I would not be surprised if the delivery kid got the order and then went to smoke a bowl or go to a friends house before delivering it to us. That or they just let our stuff sit under a hot lamp. I never thought you could really mess up Chinese food but this was proof that you actually can. That food was obviously made LONG before it ever made it to us. 
My orders have always been filled quickly, and the service is pleasant.
We have ordered from Grand China a few times and have yet to be let down.  Food for 6 (with a bunch of left overs) came out to about 70$, delivery included.  The only thing that kept it from getting that fifth star is that the Chicken Fried Rice and Chicken Lo Mein were a bit light on the meat.  In my experience, Chinese food runs the gambit and even with those 2 dishes being a bit light on the meat, the quality was excellent, the portions were nice sized, and every last dish was quite tasty.  My in-laws are very picky about their Chinese food and this is one of their favs.
I am surprised this place has gotten such low rating!
also, the place does not look all too spectacular.  it is small.  it is in front of the Fantastik Swap Meet, but hell it the most yummy chinese food in VEGAS!!!
Prices are very reasonable, and they are great at accommodating large parties on little notice. The service is great, and i have had no trouble at all getting my meal in a timely fashion when stopping in on my way to another commitment.
ASK FOR THE "OTHER MENU" just in case the "normal" menu isn't enough.
Your Braised String Beans!  Your Eggplant with Garlic Sauce!  So good, every single time.  And I have thoroughly enjoyed the wide variety of soups you expertly prepare.  I am particularly partial to Vegetables Egg Roll.  
The food is GREASY dripping GREASY! The waiter dropped the food left on the table onto the floor then swept it up. 
- Beautiful decor
Gordon Ramsey and his Kitchen Nightmare team need to visit this place. I know the owner is a nice person and her son, looks like he hates working here and probably only doing it to help his family out.
Suggestion:  Look through all the incredible pictures people put up.  I already have my next meal planned! (pork belly, water boiled fish, spicy cucumber)
King Wongs is my delivery chinese go-to. Sam is always on time with my order (yes, we are on a first name basis) and the food is always great. They always throw in free egg rolls or crab puffs which is of course awesome. Oh and the portions are huge, always eating on it for like 3 days. Never been to the actual place, but def recommend for delivery.
As a vegan, I was absolutely delighted to be dining at a Wynn restaurant, knowing there would absolutely be delicious food for me to eat.  I started with a soy Thai Iced Tea and I nearly lost my mind, it was so good.  I ordered two vegan dim sums, the white lotus and jade dumplings, at the waitress' suggestion.  I don't remember what's actually in them (spinach?  mushrooms?) but they were both fantastic.  For my main, I had the Vegan Tofu Shiitake.  It was okay, but a little boring!  We had some hot chili paste with the dumplings so I liberally spooned that over my food to give it some oomph.  Even boring tofu and mushrooms can still hit the spot, and I left quite full.
The food is a hit in my books a great option to if you want to venture away from the strip.
PS.. Wahsun rocks my world!
One time, I remember, it was a Chinese woman behind the counter and boy, what an attitude.  I think if I were white, she'd have treated me better.  Maybe Asians with their own kind, they feel they can give poor customer service to because we're willing to take it, but since there are plenty of other places to eat at, especially Panda's, it's not a good idea to treat your Asian clientele like crap.
Amazing Chicken: I'm torn on this one. On the one hand, I'm not crazy about the sauce. On the other hand, the chicken and vegetables were all awesome. Like everything else I've mentioned, the food is all cooked right and I could tell from eating this that I won't be disappointed if I order something else from here. Don't get me wrong, I don't dislike this dish or even the sauce, it's just that I'll probably go with something else next time.
Cheap, good chinese food. They were very busy, which is a great sign.
Although a diner in a compact wheelchair was able to be seated, it was a very tight fit and other diners had to be disrupted to be able to get this person seated.  I wouldn't recommend for wheelchairs.
We were quickly greeted and our drink order was taken. There were ladies making fresh dumplings right at the counter. We HAD to order some! We started with the Hot and Sour soup. I was one of the best I have ever had! It was filled with tons of veggies, tofu and egg. It had a great kick and tons of flavor.
Food made to order, fresh ingredients, friendly staff and fair prices! What more can you ask for?  I stopped in after working in the field all day.  I was staying at a hotel close by and my fellow Yelpers did not let me down.  I played it safe and had the beef fried rice and the beef broccoli. 
I want it to come to Chicago so badly, but the competition might stave it for now.
We are glad we stepped out of the box because it was excellent.  The orange tofu had an excellent glaze and still kept it's nice softness on the inside.  Same with the curry. The curry was nice and spicy, just like it's supposed to be and doesn't kill you with the spice.
If you have read any of my reviews on Vegas Chinese Food, you know how I feel and all the risk I am taking with trying a new place. But I was pleasantly surprised.
The bastards at corporate (presumably) recently removed my favorite entree from their regular menu, Dali chicken, so I've been doing some experimenting and the last two visits I tried items from their current Summer seasonal menu, the Thai Chiang Mai Curry Chicken Noodles and the Korean BBQ Chicken Stir Fry.   Those PF Changs cooks are masters of all Asian cuisines apparently.  The stir-fry was good, but not something I'd be devastated if it never came back once Summer ends.  The chicken was reminiscent of how Changs does most of their stir-fried chicken dishes, but just with different veggies mixed in and topped with a "kimchi slaw".  None of the flavors they tried to emulate really stood out to me which would be impossible if the kimchi was anything like traditional Korean kimchi.  Overall it was still tasty and I was able to finish it all.
I prefer not to eat faux Chinese food but if I'm outnumbered and the majority votes for this place and I'm eating for free then, I don't have a choice. We get food here every so often since our office is in Summerlin. They cater/deliver. The ordering process can be tedious. Language barrier/ hearing problems? Whatever it is, it would take you at least 5 minutes to order over the phone.
The service is really friendly and efficient too. I guess the only thing that gets me is the ambience, or lack thereof. It's fine, but just fine.
My companion ordered the sweet and sour chicken...completely inedible. It was dark in color, over cooked, and we could not find evidence of chicken present inside the crispy chunks. He took two bites and threw the whole meal away. It left a bad after taste in his mouth.
Two words, SHRIMP SHIT!  They do not devien their shrimp or at least that night they didn't, which means I will never eat here again.  I love shrimp fried rice and decided to place an order to go since they are right down the street from my house.  I was so disappointed too see the shrimp had not been devien.  This may not be a problem for some but a deal breaker for me.  If they don't clean the shrimp what else don't they clean??  The chicken chow mein was pretty good, I would give 2 stars if only they told me pork was in the egg rolls.  I guess that was my fault for assuming they were vegetable.  I wouldn't have mind chicken egg rolls but pork, uh no.  I wish the person taking the order would have said something.  My son couldn't have his favorite dish either.
Great noodles, great prices and good portion sizes.   Oddly quick service as well.
Decent food and good prices. Nothing too extraordinary as far as flavor but good value. For $6.99 the dinner special included an entree, veggie roll, crab rangoon, fried rice, soup and one fried shrimp. 
We were greeted possibly more enthusiastically than I have ever been greeted at the door. This was one friendly server and must have had something to do with management or ownership to be that excited to be there. He was indeed our server as well and the enthusiasm and friendliness lasted the whole meal.
This experience was one of the strangest I've encountered. I don't think anyone spoke full English, the service was so bad it was funny, overpriced takeout...my food came out at least 15 mins after the rest of my party--no apologies or real acknowledgement of the situation.
Good prices, decent food. A bit on the bland side for the veggies, but  good use of spices throughout the meats and soups. Good service but would appreciate it if she wasn't wearing a tank top and serving food.
Hidden across the street from the Princes st mall going towards Newtown is this sturdy decent sized chinese restaurant. I have been in a few times now once for the buffet and once just casual dining with some friends. The place is fairly large with a downstairs seating area for the larger parties.  The buffet is quite tasty and always has a good selection of dishes. I cant remember the price but its not that bad. What I really like is the main menu. Its huge! Theres like everything you could think of on there! And the Dim Sum is also really really good as well I think up there in my top 10 places for Dim Sum. But what I found was the portions of food you got where massive as well. I couldn't even finish my plate and almost burst eating my fortune cookie which is mandatory regardless if I pop like an angry bird. The servers were also friendly and made sure you were properly taken care of. Overall one of the better chinese restaurants in the city, not the best food in the world but definitely one of the best in Edinburgh.
and when i walked inside? oh man, SO gritty. this is the kind of place i think of when i think of authenticity, when i think of dishes i'll crave again and again. the smell in the air got my stomach rumbling as did the plates on everyone's tables. wednesday night and this busy? and almost everyone inside was asian? and right off the light rail? and i didn't hear a record skip and the music stop when i walked in?
As for veggies, we only ordered the sugar snaps, and I would have liked to try something else...like the lotus root, that looked amazing.  Sugar snaps were still good if you like sugar snaps. I mean, who doesn't?
SERVICE:
Bathroom is ok...light switch was dirty and seat was left up. 
One thing to say about this place: the wonton soup is DIVINE! Best I've ever had. The food is okay to me but I really just come back for the soup. The waitress kind of scares me, but she's nice enough. Seriously, try the soup!
All in all, the food was pretty good, but like anything in Vegas, it was overpriced.
best kept secret in the southeast valley, so please - don't tell too many of your friends or we'll never get a table again.... lol!!  
They have family specials, but on those, they are not too keen on changing the choices.
I absolutely adore this place! It's a bit off the strip but is so worth the trip! The soups, dumplings, and just everything in general was delicious! My brother and I loved this place so much that we came back the next day with the rest of our family.
For what it is - quick to order Chinese Food - it's pretty darn good. The food is always filling;even when I eat there, I usually have enough to bring home. In fact, for a while I decided to save money by getting one of their larger meals and eating it over 3 meals at home, maybe adding some more rice and vegetables after each meal... but I digress. 
I had the beef noodle which at first bite tasted weird, but the more I ate it, the more and more I liked it, until I realized I liked it a lot.  I can see how this would be a locals place, its in the middle of nowhere.  This belongs more in Las Vegas' chinatown, where I think it would be more successful, but I guess that's not really what the owners intend, there they are in a quiet corner of Vegas, doing there thing.
They weren't too busy the last time we went and the food came out faster than we could all get to the dishes.  We were surrounded by Kowlown crab (fried and covered in fried garlic and peppers) peking duck, singapore noodles, mushrooms with gai lon, pea shoots, peking pork, shaking beef, black bean clams and we ate it all!
f. Steamed Rock Cod with scallion, oil and soy sauce.
Hubby has been eating here for years but since I only occasionally visit WI, he never convinced me to give this little dive a try. Now I'm sad about what i've been missing! Cannot understand how they do it for SO cheap - amazingly fresh, tasty, generous Chinese. Clean, open kitchen, very fast and large variety. Liked it so much that I got a lunch special to go for the bus ride over to O'Hare. They packed it up tight but remember to take napkins, condiments and utensils. I loved the shrimp with broccoli (also had carrots) and the shrimp were large and plentiful. Wonton soup (4 big dumplings) on a cold day was delish and included in the lunch special. Also got chicken egg foo yung which included large, well filled egg roll - also tasty, mustardy sauce OK (not as good as the brown sauce I'm used to). All lunch specials include roast pork fried rice which was good enough to buy on its own. Seems like a mom/pop place so support your local Chinese joint - down with PF/PW/PE.
Oh the lady that took my order over the phone was super nice!!  This place must be awesome....
We had the trio of creme brulee for desert which included chocolate, vanilla, and ginger (yes ginger!) creme brulee.  They were all very good especially the ginger. (If you like ginger, you have to have this one!)
THE AMENITIES - everything in the place is class; they have an ice bucket in every section,so the servers can come and freshen your beverage at any time. Paper towels or hand dryers in the bathrooms? No sir,there's an attendant who hands you a warm towel to dry your hands. 
  - Wan Fu: the worst white wine in the world (that I love)
The front of the store is more tables, the rear around the corner is booths.
The food is packed with sodium.  Very salty.  I think it must be pre=prepared - not fresh.
Have eaten here several times since they opened. NEVER had a bad dish. Love the General Tao's chicken. Just wish there was one on the west side of town.
I've been going to Golden Rice for quite some time.  My Mom introduced me while she worked nearby back when I was in high school.
5. Walnut Shrimp
*Mushroom Purse
Yum.  Good egg rolls, no make that great.  Some of the best egg rolls I've ever had.  Portions are very good sized and quite tasty.  Sorry, didn't like the egg drop soup. Then again, I don't like egg drop soup.  Service is sometimes a bit slow but food does come fast after the order is taken.
It's like meeting a girl Sally who is a solid 7.  You then meet her younger sister who is the cream of the crop - a 9.5.  Sally is pretty tasty.  She represents fine dining chinese.  Her younger, hotter sister represents the other cuisines.
Before I get to the food, I should say a few words about the restaurant.  It was red, clean, modern, didn't look like your typical Chinese restaurant (but the Wynn isn't trying to give you the typical), and was very dark.  Our parents couldn't see anything, but I can see how they might have been trying to create an intimate or romantic ambiance with the dim lighting.  It really didn't do anything for me, but I can see how some people might like it or be impressed.  You know what they say about dim restaurants - it's dark so you can't see the food.
Good food off the strip! The lady who waited on us was the owner I believe she was very friendly and the sweet & pungent chicken had a unique taste unlike any of the typical sauces most Chinese restaurants use. I would definitely recommend checking it out!  I will add that there were a couple ladies in the booth behind us who were complaining that the food tasted "fake" so I guess if you're looking for some fancy Asian bistro this isn't it. But if you want some good Chinese take out style food this is the place to go
The service was ok... nothing great and nothing bad.
Here are the essential characteristics of Ghetto Chinese Food, in my opinion: 
OMG this place is SO COOL!!!!! It was like watching foodNet or No Reservations-Beijing in person.  The "noodle-master" was actually stretching out noodles and skillfully slicing off noodles behind the counter while I was eating.  The fish tanks inside the restaurants are cool but if theres a guy making noodles I highly suggest eating at the bar!  I ordered the mini-wonton soup with hand stretched noodles and it was delicious.  Very rarely have I ever had such clean, flavorful, and delicious broth in dishes like this that weren't heavily laden with fat floating on the top. My server Becky was super nice and expedient as well as the other staff that kept my water glass constantly full.    It's kinda pricey at almost $20.00 but I am for SURE going back.
We had lunch here again. Food was superb as usual. More staff on hand so service was prompt.
A three hour walking exploration of Las Vegas' Chinatown culminated with a large and delicious lunch here.  Relying once again on the ratings of Las Vegas Yelpers I decided to check out this spacious restaurant along Spring Mountain Road.
The restaurant itself during the day is very pretty. Yellow and white  with white floral and butterfly accents. The windows look out to the Bellagio Fountains, and you get a free closeup show every 30 minutes or so. One time they even opened the doors and we stood right next to the water!
I knew that my party of four would be ordering lots, and when we entered the restaurant with its nicely redecorated walls, only one couple was there, so I asked for a lazy Susan table. I'm sure the likely proprietor who graciously assented to this request did not regret letting us occupy a table for 8, because by the end of our repast smokin' dishes were being added next to dinner plates because the lazy Susan was already full of entrees. 
However, my low rating is because of their snooty attitude, particularly towards the kids. They didn't actually say anything, but we felt uncomfortable having the kids here. just not terribly welcoming compared to all the other eateries we've tried at the MGM.
Just visited Cafe Noodle tonight. Good food and reasonable prices. The restaurant itself isn't much to look at, seems a little sloppy to me but can't complain. The tung choy was delicious.. veggies and rice were great and the main course was even better. I will definitely be back soon. Real chinese food at a great price!
Bland food, over priced, and crowded seating. I really wanted to like this place, but even for San Tan Valley it is terrible.
The price is cheap which is the only thing going for them (in my opinion) but the taste is very bland for the type of Chinese I was hoping they would be.
Lunch menu is the best deal around, you get entree,pork fried rice, and egg roll or soup for like $5.99 plus tax.  I love the Wonton Soup. Once you find a dish you love you will keep coming back. Take out is your best bet. Seating is limited.
We are always looking for good Chinese food and I can't believe never tried Mr. Chao's in our own backyard.  We read about it in the Ahwatukee Foothills News "best of Ahwatukee".    
been here 2x now and have to say both times its been off the charts. 
The line was incredibly long and is definitely not worth the wait. There are so many other Chinese/noodles places in Vegas, I suggest you not waste your time here. Two stars.
(The food I order here is tongue-numbingly spicy and may include parts of the animal normally eaten by Andrew Zimmern)
Some of my favorite dishes here:
Seriously, you have to try this place, you can't go wrong.
This place is fantastic!! Definitely my go to for Chinese food(: so fast and tasty! The coffee milk tea is the shizz and they are extremely inexpensive and give big portions! You definitely get more than you pay for!
I decide to step outside to try and calm what could be an awful frenzy of spending. Pick Up Stix looks like a great place to grab a quick bite so I stop by. 
Now the Singapore noodles made me happy- they were the right flavors and nicely cooked. I've tried at a few Chinese spots around Chinatown and was kinda disappointed. The problem is I've find a lot of places get this either too dry or too greasy, not enough curry flavor. This was yummy and I will come back even simply for this. It was very authentic to what I remember it to taste like in Hong Kong and what friends parents have cooked at home. It was like $7....only other place with comparable noodles (so far) is Noodles Asia in Venetian which cost double the price for the location. I will come here instead.
great for hangovers when you do not want to drive outside the strip. it's a bit pricy, but the food comes out fast and it's pretty damn good. the service is like any other asian restaurant which is fast, rude, and kind of annoying...or i maybe saying that because every time i come here i'm realllly hungover haha.
The BBQ pork (char siu) and chicken is decent also. I prefer fatty char siu... the tastiest part of the char siu =P
The service was fantastic... 5 STARS
They have the regular Chinese menu you find at every Chinese restaurant. I ordered the Szechuan Beef with no msg, fried rice with chicken. The other people with me ordered Beef and broccoli, General Tsao's chicken, and Mongolian Beef. It was all pretty good for a fast food place. It was what I expected. The only complaint I have is that I ordered my food spicy and it was not spicy at all.
The fancy is in the food!  This by far was the second best chinese food I have had (other place was in China Town in San Fran).  I ordered the Sesame Chicken and it was just the right flavor, and crispy and not doughy.  Very nice quality food.
I'm giving four stars based on how it compares with other restaurants on the strip. Very reasonably priced, decent food and pretty quick. The Sunday brunch buffet is basic but it's only $12.95 which is about half the price of other Sunday buffets.
We were looking for somewhere to eat before Zumanity.  We called Chin Chin and made reservations a few hours before just to be on the safe side.  When we arrived there was a small line - but we got right in.  Service was a little slow and the food was just plain blah.  I am shocked that people recommend this place and use the word superb in their reviews.
Nice ambience, good meal, just prepare to fork over a ton of money.
Great for takeout. One of the best Chinese take out plsces I've tried. Delicious fried rice and the hunan beef is to die for.
Tonight was my first time here (it's pretty new) I didn't expect much as we were just passing by and it was the only non-fast food in eye-shot. But boy were we surprised! 
I eat here under the same circumstances as when I would eat at Faustos--when I'm starving, low on cash, tipsy, or have many mouths to feed. Get the pot stickers. They're homemade and the dipping sauce is delicious. Another favorite of mine is the war wonton soup.
Phili roll -- amazingly good high quality sushi rice everything worked real nicely. 
Service was quick.  Probably won't be coming back though, since there are other great restaurants in the area.
- free desserts
Its a takeout spot but if you do eat in- bathroom is clean and its by the light-rail. Why not 5 stars ? The crab puff use to be amazing and now it is more like a won ton :/ everything else is still amazing :) enjoy!
For some bizarre reason, on the weekends, it is filled with asian-women/white guy couples,    which strikes me as hilarious.  If it wasn't for this,  I would eat there multiple times a week. 
The place is not so clean.  Their seats are eh.
Had the Singapore noodles and the potstickers. The potstickers were pretty good-- a mixture of deep fried/pan-fried with a small amount of meat and vegetables inside. Relatively thick dumpling skin compared to filling. 
Just ok...nothing special.  We went here for lunch the other day and it took quite a while for someone to seat us even though the restaurant was mostly empty.  The service was ok, the atmosphere was nice, but the food really wasn't that good.
The people who worked there (especially the younger girl) were awesome.  Lots of personality and very helpful.  This place will quickly become a take-out favorite of ours.
Anywho. I shared the Crab Rangoon with my friends and ordered the Spicy Yunnan Rice Noodle Soup. Crab Rangoon was good. It's very crisp and not burnt, quite filling for the creamy cheesy texture. $14 for a bowl of noodle that normally sells for half the price. Luckily, the portions are bigger than what it normally is. Ingredients wasn't anything too spectacular, just the usual shrimp and veggies. I ended up eating only half of the portion.  Food isn't extremely great, it's better presentation than regular Chinese food places. Taste is there, pretty standard. But my dish wasn't spicy at all, which was  a disappointment in that sense. When I see "Spicy" and a chili pepper symbol next to the menu item, I want some kick in it. 
Crab Rangoon(8)  3.75 - Just Plain YUMMY!
As for the service, it depends on how you look at it. Don't be afraid to get up and refill your own water. Shoot, the waitress is the only one that's there, give her a break already. She must own the joint with her husband because there is always this little kid in the corner playing on his laptop. So, get your own water and your own take home containers if you want. She doesn't have a problem with it.
-Beef & Asparagus: way too salty
By far the best Chinese food in the valley. Located in central PHX, on NW corner of Camelback and Central. Family owned for 20+ years. Open forlunch and then dinner. Closed 2-5.
Nice..., hope you like it too!
Crab Rangoon -- If not the best I have had to date, lightly deep fried honestly I couldn't even tell it was put in a fryer no resemblance of fryer oil nor smell. This is honestly really really good. (5 pieces give or take ) 
The items are rather hit and miss on the menu. I enjoyed the Kung Pao Chicken and Szechuan Chicken, but everything else has proved to be rather disappointing. I was very disappointed to find that the Honey Garlic Chicken is essentially the same thing as Sweet and Sour Chicken, only with a nastier sauce. 
I loved this place! Friends of ours took us here and the first thing I noticed was that it was clean, which is always a bonus. The women was very nice and the food was great. It tasted very fresh! Would make the extra 15 minute drive to pick this up!
Would order from here again. Seems like it may be worth dining in next time.
The rookie, the 12 year old son says "is it like Panda Express?".  BLAH!  So we asked what closely resembles teriaki chicken and they whipped some up though its not on the menu.  I thought it was bland, but it was full of carrots and green beans and was exactly what the kid hoped.  PERFECT!
Good food, right up there with KJ Kitchen and no long wait.lunch special pricing up till 4:30pm.check this place out.
Wow really good!  Filling, fast, and yummy!
Wow. You can order the standard, Chinese-American fare or you can try their dim sum. You will not be disappointed. Every weekend I crave their dim sum. No need to go to Chicago (even though the menu is relatively small). Mind you their dim sum originates from Beijing, it's unlike most dim sum in the states (southern style). The workers are nice too.
First we shared a sampler platter and then I got Hong Kong stir fry, my son got Pad Thai and his girlfriend got Singapore noodles with shrimp.  He confirmed she wanted a hot dish as she was ordering it and she said she indeed got about as hot as she could stand.  I like the fact none of the dishes were swimming in sauce, so we could taste the individual items, which can happen at many Asian restaurants.  In fact I could have used a touch more and almost used one of the dipping sauces for the last bit of rice.  Much better, in my opinion, to add a little more if needed.  The whole meal came to under $40 including soft drinks and tea.
I've never tried this place before so I went for the first time last night. I ordered a beef dish, fried rice and crab wontons with cream cheese to go. The place was packed, but it had a dirty feel to it and a lot of dirty dishes were stacked in tubs behind the counter. What really disturbed me, though, was that while I was waiting for my food near the register, I had a full view of what was happening in the kitchen since there was no partition. Right in front of the entrance, the cook took out three huge blocks of boneless, frozen chicken parts onto the counter. After sitting they'd thawed a few minutes, I watched him feed them through a deli slicer, into small blocks, presumably to be thawed and cooked up, fat and all. I did not get the impression that the meat was or would be carefully inspected before being cooked. I know a lot of restaurants probably prepare meat that way, but the mass qualities of untrimmed meat I saw being served made me really lose my appetite. When I got home, my wontons smelled really fishy (like they'd been cooked and sat out for a while) and the sauce on my beef was just slimy enough that anything left of hunger quickly fled me. So basically I spent $13 to eat a carton of rice. Their prices are not cheap enough to warrant visiting this place over a quality establishment. Will not be returning.
Tasty boba, I like honeydew & taro
The staff wasn't rude, but certainly wasn't friendly. We typically like the Panda Express stores near us but unfortunately this experience was bad enough that I think it will be a long while before we visit any others.
Check it out!
When your hungover as F*#K and in caesars palace this is the place to go to get some hot soup to cure that hangover! been here many times cause im way to hung over to go anywhere and room service doesn't have what you need. soup, noodles everywhere, if your looking for it they probably have it, chinese noodles and soup and chinese food only though (THEY NEED TO SERVE PHO) but anyways i always start with the chinese breadsticks or donut?! than won ton soup with egg noodles cant go wrong, they def use out of the packet egg noodle but its still good, i haven't had any problems with food here but the service is pretty bad; you order, get your food and thats it you will not see your server till your ready to pay? weird or coincidence? Anyways i only go here when im hungover so i cant really give the best rating but so far ive had a decent experience so nothing bad to say here
Stop by this place on a whim.  Ordered the Mongolian Beef and Orange Chicken (white meat, which is nice).  The Mongolian Beef was very tasty.  But the Orange Chicken could use a bit of improvement on the flavor.  They got the order ready at the time they said they would.  Also the corn egg soup was nice and light.  Would definitely go back to pick up food on this place.
It's a short review, I know...but sometimes short and sweet is just what the doctor ordered.
This place is great very clean and they have great customer service. I have been coming to this place for the past two years. If you want healthy, inexpensive food Stir Fry is the place to go
One of the best meals I've had in Las Vegas.  I'm usually a steakhouse person, however my husband loves Chinese cuisine so we went to Pearl on a busy Friday night.  The food was the best Chinese I've had... flavor, spice level, temperature, and portions were all perfect.  The service from start to finish was top notch.  The greeter and servers were friendly, professional, and seemed to sincerely care about our dining experience.  We will be back to Pearl!
Love this restaurant and love Sean, the waiter.
With a handful of customers on a weekday, they asked if we were there for dim sum.  They then provided us with their dim sum menu and their secret menu of things listed only in Chinese.  (Now, many small mom and pop restaurants have this secret menu - sometimes they are posted on the wall and other times they are printed out.  They are only a 'secret' if you can't read Chinese, which is the case with me.  However, my dad can read it just fine and my mom has no shame in asking the wait staff to translate the menu for her...except that sometimes they can only translate it back in Chinese since they don't really know the English translation.  At that point, you need to understand Chinese or you're SOL.)
I haven't eaten here in quite a while so hopefully not much has changed, but this was my favorite place to get take out. The beef skewers, house fried rice, house low mein and several other dishes are simply amazing, especially when the outside looks very much like a hole in the wall. The only thing stopping me from eating here more often is the fact that it's so far away from my house. We always ordered a ton of food for pick up and were never disappointed. Hopefully I can make my way back soon because I haven't found any place that compares.
Let's get down to brass tacks- I realize the restaurant is in its infancy, and so I'm not going to judge the service too harshly here.  There were a few mishaps as I ordered (not shocking, since I ordered based on other Yelpers' reviews, having been unsuccessful at locating an actual menu), and the food took an hour and forty minutes to show up.  The driver was really nice, though, and they tossed some sort of tripe dish into one of the bags, presumably to make up for the wait.  
The service was uncomfortable and odd.  It was a farily dead Sunday afternoon,  yet the bartender dropped and broke three items at 3 different times while we were there.
I tried the Vegetables with Fried Noodles on my first trip for $7.25.  They were just okay.  Even though the noodles are being made right there and you can watch through the window the taste was very similar to Panda Express to me.
But you are sooooo...............................BORING. 
Overall the everything was just "OK". The service is good. Food came out fast but it just wasn't that amazing. I don't think i would go back that often. Maybe once every 2-3 months.
I wouldn't call it great food. I had lunch here and the wonton soup was good. The Orange flavored chicken was average or even a little less than average. The fried rice that came with it was.....well....it tasted like white rice. Looked similar to fried but was pretty boring too. 
The food is not taste good and the price is higher than other Chinese restaurants. When finished, they add the tips by themselves. This is really rude.
This was not bad...I didn't find it very tender, but good taste!  I thought the beef was a little chewy, but it's not a bad choice overall with the tomato rice.
Good food. We have eaten here several times, always takeout. They get a little upset when you ask for lemon, but the food is good.
Assorted Seafood Noodle Soup 3/5
I stopped by to place a large order. I walked into what appeared to be a bar with a Chinese  food side business. 2 people at the bar had obviously been served 1 or 5 too many drinks.  The couple behind the bar never stopped to say hi or can I help you? I picked up a menu and waited to be acknowledged and to place an order. When I gave up, after several minutes, I walked out. As I was walking out the guy behind the bar said, "Sorry we were ignoring  you". I ignored them and heard them and the 2 drunks laughing. They lost my $100 order and I hope yours too.
One tip: Reheating salt/peper pork chop through either microwave or toaster oven will yield the same result, which is stringy stale pork chop. :=)
I've gone here a bunch of times and really enjoy the food. The prices are good and the portions are huge. Staff is friendly and the food comes out quick. I'm partial to the orange chicken myself, which I think is one of the best for American-Chinese food.
True story: I tried to bribe the guy $100 to reopen the restaurant 5 minutes after it closed at 3am.  He thought about it.  For maybe 30 seconds.  Then we were forced to leave empty handed to the terribleness that is Grand Lux Cafe.  Never again.
I got a one item combo plate with nothing else for $9. I asked for half and half fried rice/chow mein, and I ordered their sesame chicken.
Phad Thai Noodles- smelt like Alpo. Taste was mild, shrimp were bland
For its price and location, the people who work there aren't very well trained.  One waitress was throwing the chopsticks around when she was setting up the table.  
Go Sundays for 50% off sushi. The sushi bar guy was awesome and didn't mind me taking pictures. He even posed for a couple. The sushi is good, not the best I've had, but pretty decent. The chicken chow mein was pretty darn tasty especially after a couple of drinks.
The food: Absolutely amazing. We split a chef's tasting menu as well as an additional entree (thankfully, they didn't charge shared plate fees), which was great in itself because normally if one person gets the tasting menu, your whole table is in. Every single item that came to our table was top notch. Even the water tasted better! If I didn't know better, I'd say they were drugging us to like the food. The chocolate lava raspberry something kind of cake with gold garnishment at the top was to die for. I was extremely stuffed at the end of the meal, but I would've napped and eaten dinner #2 there if the restaurant wasn't closing for the evening.
The noodles were taking an excrutiatly long time to come out. 
All I have to say is fuck wow! Incredible! The view is breathtaking, but the star of the show is the food. From the appetizer to the dessert, everything was world class.
Ming's Table isn't as bad as most people make it out to be.  But it isn't exactly a place you'd should have dinner at.  For lunch it's not too bad of a deal with their midweek special.  I only came here for the $19.99 all you can eat sushi and minced beef soup deal (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/NFOj3uboFzeNF5X-dWUd_w?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw).  The sushi was pretty bland but I didn't care, I was hungry and wanted a quick lunch and that's exactly what I got, plain and simple.  Might come here for lunch again if I'm staying at Harrah's like last time.  It was a nice convenience.
The -'s:
I can put away a lot of food, but had leftovers. The food is all cooked to order. Served hot. Seasoned well. Even the egg drop soup was seasoned well. 
Now they have ice cream! 
Amazing! The food here is so authentic! All of the taste of street food in China but none of the sickness that comes with eating Chinese street food. It's also quite cheap, $3.75 for a jianbing? Wow!
Service was amazing- so very nice, knowledgeable & accommodating- and deserves 5 stars! My friends and I were looking for a good place to eat around Chinatown. We wanted to try something new, so I went to Yelp and found this little gem. We went to their website and looked over the menu, which was extensive and had a range of items from Noodle Soups to Porridges to Sandwiches and everything else in between set at very reasonable prices. The pictures featured on their website were tantalizing to look at, enough so that my friends immediately knew what they were going to order.
So I'd give it 2 stars for delivery time and value.. but the hair thing was pretty gross.. and nothing else was very good.  Sorry.. 1 star.
Anyways, I highly recommend the Shanghai rice cakes. Also the Shanghai noodles. I also really enjoy their hot and sour soup, although it's not spicy enough for me it's plenty tasty. The chinese sausage fried rice is also super delicious and they give you a big mound of fried rice.
Still,  it's hard to give them a better rating when a simple standard dish such as Mapo tofu and Hot and sour soup was horrid.  Soup was overly sour and the Mapo tofu had no taste.   It just tasted like tofu with cornstarch cooked into it.  No flavor.  None.  Maybe some salt?   The crispy noodles and Mongolian beef was decent.   I added an extra star because these two dishes were borderline food court level.   The shu mai dimsum appetizer was also decent but nothing special.  $9 for 6 pieces.    Every dish was around $15+ but that's because it's inside a hotel.   All the cooks and servers were Asian.  Service was Asian like.   That means it was below average.   Don't expect superb food,  ambience or service here.   If it weren't for my father in law wanting to give this place a try,  I'd rather go eat at Panda express.
Order this through Eat24, food was good, order chow fun. (Chow me in but with flat noodles) it was good! Even though they forgot my second order, they were polite and friendly.
I've never tried their fried rice, but their white rice (which is admittedly fairly hard to mess up) is always very good. The Won Ton Soup is also very tasty.
This used to be one of my favorite, hole in the wall Chinese take out places, then I kind of forgot about them. But they recently stuck a menu in my door so decided to try them out again. Still very tasty, and what a great deal! Lunch special is only $5.75!
This used to be our favorite place for noodles and Chinese but the new owners have turned it into more of a Vietnamese place.  Lots of pho on the new and much smaller menu.
We got take out from here, not expecting the best Chinese food in the world, but we were not expecting to get the worst! We did not like what we got at all. My white rice had a metallic taste to it, and the crab ragoons were very seafood-ish. I got a beef chow mien. The beef was ok but not great and we also got sesame chicken and they were very crunchy with little sauce. I would not recommend Chinese food from here!
We walked in, and I have no Idea why, but we had to wait for 10 minutes or so. It was 12pm and they had a bit of lunch rush going, but still, 10 minutes? But that's wasn't a big deal. I liked the ambiance of this place though.
Big portions, reasonable prices, great service...even Kiren and Stella on tap.
Not very personable. Food was the same price as a full restaurant but all you get is a few tables and hard chairs. Don't eat in! Food was good but the price was a bit on the high side
The soup was pretty tasty and had many wontons in it.  My friend commented that it tasted like carrots however there were no carrots in the soup.  Either way, I think that was probably the best dish of the bunch.
The egg rolls are mammoth. almost as big as a coke can. They are full of shrimp, pork, and chicken. There is a bit of ginger flavor inside as well. They weren't like anything I've ever tasted before. Intense and beyond delicious. 
  Price: 6.99
Stopped in for a quick dinner with the family. The first thing that we notice is that the place is fairly rundown. The second thing we notice is that the AC does not work very well. It was really hot in the place. 
Hot and sour soup had a gallon of vinegar
Lobster, sea bass, beef and mushroom with oyster sauce, and steamed cod was all great. Only issue was the fried tofu needing a sauce since it was like just eating french fries. I recommend the sweet and sour sauce. 
The Sesame Chicken, however, was a disappointment.  It was just... not good.
       - $6.00 Grilled Beef Tongue - 3 Skewers with 3 pieces of tongue each. It was a little dry and not flavored well.
Also, the chef seems to enjoy trying new things, can't fault him for that.  I understand, you want something "authentic" -- but I found this to be true to a Hong Kong style cafe -- at least, in its varied menu with solid sweets.  Reminds me of home.
Very good food! Their service was awesome and im from california! Definitely will come back.
The bad, their fried rice isn't the best,  the fountain drink selection is to small and they don't have a lunch menu.  The good, their sushi(for the location) is awesome along with anything seafood and veggies here!  The sauces used on their seafood and veggie dishes are delicious.  
The Cons:
I don't know what happened to the Egg Foo Young since I first tried it, but I no longer recommend it. The patties are smaller and the gravy was thinner and tasted watered down. What a disappointment!
I ordered from here last weekend and so far so good.  I ordered two things and the volume of food was so much that I actually didn't run out until last night.  To me that's pretty impressive to order something and be able to make it stretch for dinner every night of the week for 6 days straight.  Considering the volume I'd say the price wasn't bad either.
I have been eating at Wendy's many times during the past two years. Yet I have never written a review. I love this restaurant. Not only is the owner thouroughly involved,  she cares about her customers. If she is there, she comes to the table and asks about our dining experience. No matter what I have ordered there, it has been delicious. Their Shanghai dumplings are the best we have had. My daughter spent a year in China, and she loved them, they are also my husbands favorite. The menu could be overwhelming and there are so many things I want to try, but we seem to forget. The wonton noodle soup with duck roasted duck is always my go to.  I like the fact that they have a tapas menu so you can try different things. I have had the chicken wings and the short ribs, both good. I can't wait to try the rest. Will definitely be back, I've never had a bad meal.
I am always on the lookout for a good chinese restaurant so I am gonna go back and try some of their other stuff!
It does have a great low-carb menu and the service is fine.
shrimp tempura roll
We are finally starting to get to know our Vegas neighborhood, so we decided on this trip to only choose to eat in our area.  Since we were feeling Chinese, we stopped in here.  SO GLAD we did.  The food is really good.  You can taste the fresh in every bite.  Veggies are crispy, sauces are so tasty and the know how to cook shrimp.  I LOVE when shrimp is not over cooked.  We ordered the Schzechuan Shrimp and it was delicious.  The Pepper Beef, delicious lot's of beef and loaded with crunchy bell peppers.  The house fried rice is really good.  We didn't care for the twice cooked pork, I found the pork chewy and not very tasty.  Their eggrolls were on point as were their cream cheese wontons.
There service is fabulous and the food consistent.   We started our meal with a Chinese beer and appetizers (potstickers, and Veggie-rolls).   The orange-chicken meal was fabulous and all the servings are for two, possibly three people (i.e. easily shared).  I also tried the Sweet and Sour Chicken....so tender and yummy.
I have only ever had the wonton soup here.  I order it without noodles and it is some of the best I've had.  I love the slightly sweet, aromatic broth and the dumplings are very good.  I've heard the other food is just so-so and I haven't tried it.  But I am a repeat customer for their wonton soup.  
Things to avoid: Cashew Chicken (It just wasn't my favorite....though it's the only thing I've found there that I wasn't fond of.)
ETA: I forgot to mention that as long as you live reasonably close to the restaurant, they will deliver for a small fee. So now you have even less excuse to not give it a try.
This place is a hit or miss.  When it is a hit, it's a 4 star, when it miss, it's a 2 star...
Ma Po Tofu
I ended up picking up and it was ready in about 12 mins.
Other than that, I'd avoid this place, unless I somehow attracted your tastebuds...
I can tell the difference between chow mein and lo mein so apparently that qualifies me to be a fucking interpreter of the culture.
Best Chinese food in surprise and very friendly environment.
There is nothing particularly stunning or revolting about Jade Garden: it is what it is.  I ordered from here all the time in college - cheap food, specials every so often if you Google it, pretty quick turnaround as well.
Most vegetarian-friendly of all the restaurants in New York New York. 
Over the past five years I have eaten at Gourmet Wok 15-20 times. I have eaten in and carried out. The food (especially the Lunch Special) is a good value and consistently tastes good to me. Not fancy...just a  nice, hearty meal. The serving size is ample and the workers are friendly.
After a long night (doesn't every Vegas night feel long?!) and an impending cold, I really needed some comfort food. And that usually means something soupy. Although I knew the emptiness of the restaurant implied not-so-great food, I wanted quiet time and dedicated service. 
Prices are a bit steep relative to normal Asian places, but obviously there's going to be a premium for being where you're at.  They're probably betting that you're not going to go out somewhere off the strip in search of cheaper Chinese food in that desert heat.  And being a casino, they're taking the smart bet.  At least they don't cheat you on your order; portions are still pretty respectable.
The experience at this restaurant was great.  It was definitely geared toward the trendy and expensive side of people and I don't know if I'd ever pay this much for Chinese food again, but it was quite the experience.  Service was excellent also.  I'd recommend if you had some cash to blow on pretty good food and presentation (albeit Chinese) to give it a shot.  As far as their audit went, they scored pretty well and they're still there!
We are still searching for a fantastic place, can't seem to find one in vegas.
  Ordering through Eat24 was painless once I enabled Javascript.
You'll see a ton of these yelp reviews deride the decor or the service or the atmosphere. These are the kinds of kids that like places like Imperial Garden. Who likes that place? (I do. Kind of a lot. I think?). You'll also see a ton of these yelp reviews glow over Sichuan food and eating stuff like oxtail and tripe or pickled soup. I am a big fan, and their spicy crispy chicken is my jam. The only thing I got here that I didn't like was the Kung Pao chicken - it didn't pack much heat and the sauce was thick and sweet. I think they thought I was getting something from the Americanized menu.
Definitely a place to pacify Asian parents and snobby Chinese foodies from San Fran or LA, so if you don't fall under either category, you know it's going to be pretty damn good.   Have to warn you that the service can be a little apathetic and inconsistent, but as long as the food is consistently delivered with wok hay, I'm willing to let some things slide!
Half fried chicken: They have a few options of fried chicken and honestly I can't remember which one I ordered, but I think it was the Queen.  Either way, it was super crispy skin and moist chicken pieces with that great salt and sugar to sprinkle on top.  Great dish and it satisfied that fried chicken craving I had for days.  No one can go wrong with any of their fried chicken.  If you prefer no salt, they serve it on the side anyway, so season to your liking!  Even without the side salt, the skin has a nice flavor to it and has that hint of salt and pepper.
The service is fantastic. Especially this one gentlemen that works there, that always seems to be wearing a bow-tie. He is friendly and funny, and I get excited whenever we are seated in his section. With that said, I don't want to take away from the other people that work there, because they are all awesome too. I am yet to have a sub-par experience with the staff.
Short: Pass on it, go to Krazy Buffet or any other place. Sub-average food, bad service, terrible atmosphere.
Want authentic national and regional Asian cuisines, look off the Strip.  Looking for some great cocktails and correctly cooked "Asian" inspired food Rice and Company modestly delivers.
As asian buffets go, this is very worthwhile.   It has a new, sharp, clean, bright quality in the decor that extends to how efficiently and pleasantly the staff keep dish trays fresh and brimming with glistening choices.  It is remarkably seafood strong (mostly shrimp - - one downer was how tough the salmon felt when poked with the spoon), and otherwise heavily chicken oriented.   I don't like chicken, but many people seem to like chicken.    It is a bit of a salt-orgy, but if you pick and choose carefully (story of current degustatory civilization) it is an exceptionally well-run and bountifully arrayed buffet with remarkably high standards given the genre.
you are given a scale.
Last night we attempted to go again.  It was very warm as soon as we walked in.  The same server as the last time greeted us.  I asked if the air conditioning was on and she walked away without answering.  She returned a couple minutes later, presumably to take our beverage order.  Again I asked if she could turn down the thermostat.  She responded rudely saying, "You do it."  Not feeling comfortable taking that upon myself. I asked for the manager.  Raymond came over and said he didn't have authority to do that and would have to ask his uncle.   At that point, we said we were leaving.  We were not sitting in a restaurant that was 82+ degrees and smelly....we love their food, but this group of servers had no idea about customer service.
This location will only get better as it ages.
People must have to convince themselves that this place is good because it's the trendy thing to do. But you're better off going elsewhere if you want good Chinese food.
Lets commence with the actual store. The location is very clean and organized. I am surprised that they have so many staff members being that is it kind of small. (maybe they have the whole family)
I've been wanting to try this place since moving to Chandler last month and especially after reading the reviews.  Ordered take out tonight and it was absolutely delicious!  They take "carbs" to a whole new level :)  The noodles stand on their own....you can absolutely tell that they are homemade.  The thick noodles (there are several varieties) with minced pork sauce have a wonderful savory flavor and include diced cabbage and green onions.  The egg rolls were just as delicious and even the chicken fried rice (I know, rice at a noodle place?) was perfectly prepared.
- Steamed dumplings : Just ok. 
Dragon Way offers Chinese and Cantonese food inside their large, well placed, ever so slightly kitsch restaurant
About 10 minutes later our drinks arrive and they must have been sitting out for a really long time because the ice was all melted in them. Still no appetizer. By then, my sister, who is a waitress was growing irritable because she has two kids to feed and our appetizer still wasn't out. 
Perhaps they have an amazing dinner menu, who knows, but Nee House was Needless to say not as Neelicious as I expected to be.  If this is the best that Phoenix has to offer in authentic Chinese cuisine, I would say it barely passed the test in my eyes.
It can be a little hard to find if you don't know where you are going but if you can remember it's right between the Starbucks and Dominoes Pizza next to the RIde Now you'll find it easily enough.
Dessert - I rarely get dessert here, but on my last visit I got a Mango Sorbet.  It was served on a dish and the server brought me a spoon to eat it with....which was very difficult because the hard texture made digging into it with a spoon challenging.  In the end, I used a fork to eat it.
-Buddha's feast pan-toasted noodles 
Revisited the China Grill last weekend during a trip to Las Vegas.  We tried the 'new" Sampling Menu.  It's a little pricey at $72.00 per person but soooo worth it.  The food again comes in family style servings.  Way to much food to eat with a total of six dishes.  
We came here as a mid week treat for the business lunch deal. 7.50 of your pounds for two (small starters) one dumpling dish and a noodle or soup dish. Even though we were a bit taken aback from the portions, all these combined are fairly filling!(my memory with names is appalling, but bare with me all of these are listed on the business menu)
Based on what you are getting for the price, it's definitely not worth it, but due to the limited selection of Asian cuisine in Las Vegas, this will do...for now.
When we got home and saw the food, at first we couldn't tell which entree was which.  They were both loaded with onions and peppers, I mean LOADED. Easily half of the entrees were filler vegetables.  I expect some in most dishes, but this was like they ran out of protein and had to make the container full.  The flavor of the dishes was generic, but if I hadn't seen a few jalapeños in my honey chicken I would have thought I had received the wrong order, not any honey flavor to me, just salty soy... Certainly not the flavor I was looking for.  The crab rangoons didn't even have a tablespoon of bland filling in each, they were actually indented on the bottom instead of the plump pockets I'm accustomed to.  
Tried this restaurant for the first time today.  I am used to the best Chinese food in the U.S.  As I have eaten in NYC's, SF's and LA's Chinatowns.  This is the only Chinese restaurant that is like eating in NYC's Chinatown.  It is true Cantonese style cooked by Chinese chefs. 
This place is great for big parties and family dining. I recommend if your in the area since there isn't much Asian restaurants around.
Tonight,, we came across a very rude, short bald guy.  He assured me they never had chow fun and that I must've went somewhere else.  He even went as far as showing me the menu.  I told him I knew it wasn't on the menu but they made it before.  I asked him to ask the chef, he refused.  Whatever.  I let it go and tried to order our other dishes but this guy kept talking about the beef chow fun.  At one point, I asked him to drop it.  Instead of dropping it, he proceeded to tell my mom that he could make it at home, but he can't bring it from home.  Really?  WTF?  Drop it dude.  We tried to continue to order but he kept talking about the beef chow fun and laughing at us.
My dining companion and I split crab angels, orange chicken, and scallop with garlic sauce. The crab angels were a tad overstuffed with cream cheese, but the outsides were crisp and quite good. The orange chicken was pretty standard - thoroughly breaded with a hint of spiciness - and did not disappoint. The scallops, however, were less than spectacular; it also lacked the shrimp the menu claimed to be among the contents of the dish. 
Cashier was behind counter picking his teeth was a toothpick but i didn't think much of it because he was the cashier and not the cook. So I continued with my order because it was semicheap.
Very nice lunch specials always very consistent . My Sugestion is to go eat in instead of Togo as you don't get soup and the portion is smaller.. Otherwise always good and fresh!
Being coming here for over 15yrs one of the best cheap Chinese food places in Las Vegas always clean and friendly and of course the food is amazing.
I shall preface this by saying I'm a vegetarian, which is the reason for such a poor star rating. If you're a meat eater, disregard my review. You might think I'm a jerk for giving a bad review of a place with the word "seafood" in the name, because of their lack of veggie options. But I have my reasons.
We left to go tend to laundry and sat to eat our food. My cashew chicken was made with peanuts instead... wrong dish or bad disguise? Fiancee got the bourbon chicken of some kind. Flavor was good but the cuts of chicken were pretty bad. Stringy and fatty. Fried rice was just fluffy white rice with nothing in it. Egg rolls were good.
I will return!
The whole concept of Chinese & Western decorative fusion looked pretty interesting at first, but that hype quickly faded as we seated ourselves and witnessed the staff's cold shoulders. Midway through our meal, one of the waiters abruptly came over and asked 'Finish?' Before my friend could even reply no, the waiter was gone and we were left staring at each other. I didn't really know how to feel about the fishtanks that lined up the entrance to the restaurant and allow me to drop in a quick recommendation as an alternative. The new Bachannal Buffet is not a far walk from here. Walk over there and get your money's worth!
Went here for a nice dinner before a show at the Mirage. Wished we had gone somewhere else. Our waitress hovered near our table the entire dinner, very awkward. We had the potstickers which were good, the chicken chow mein and the kung pow chicken were tasteless with zero flavor. Save your money!
As I thought. Place would eventually go out of business.
I have to stress that I am very picky when it comes to Asianesque cuisine a it is my favourite food.  Ling and Louie put creative thought into the fusion bistro cafe concept and they indeed seem to "approach love and cooking with reckless abandon"!  I am a fan. I am probably not being fair to them by being a bit stingy with the fifth star, but... I am sure a few more visits and drunken chickens later and I can be swayed to loosen my clench. 
Food: Generally decent.  My only real complaint is that seasoning seems to vary every time I go; sometimes the entree tends toward the bland, and soup can be towards the salty side.  
If you a want tasty, inexpensive, asian-style meal, I recommend Pick up Stix.
Delicious! I've eaten inside the restaurant however I usually order take to go. They do not deliver which is a bummer. The food is always quick to come out and the service is always prompt and courteous. With large portions.
All and all the lunch prices are good it lasts until 4pm witch is a nice change from most places. And the staff is nice, on the way out she said your new I never seen your face here before; I thought that was kind of cute she noticed :).
Inside, it looks like a takeaway place with a few tables and smells a little greasy. It's bright and cheery enough though and the bathrooms are much much cleaner than in some places I have visited recently. I was interested to note that it served much of the standard fare but mixed it with some more interesting and rarer dishes on the menu such as steamed dumplings and spare ribs in guinness sauce. I was intrigued by the salt and pepper tofu, although I didn't get to try it on this particular trip. 
The lemon chicken is to die for. So good and the crispy coating made it all the way home. Hunan beef could be spicier. Take out order was fast, service super nice and I will go often. A great neighborhood joint!! Priced right too!
Nonetheless, the quality of the food is good enough to make the overall experience positive, and I would gladly come back for more.
I hate you Panda Express
Instead of ordering an entree I got the shrimp dumplings and chicken satay apps which were both flawless.  The shrimp dumplings are a must try if you go to Red 8.  When it was all said and done I got two large apps, miso soup, a drink, and a coffee for $30.  Pretty good by Vegas standards.
Food was okay, but service was horrible. Appetizer plates were never cleared, entrees arrived but we didn't have any silverware and had to take them from the table next to is, water was never refilled, server gave us our check before we even got our dessert. Don't think I will ever come back
Like when you order an egg roll, you actually get an egg roll, not a spring roll like everywhere else around here. 
cons- not that much taste to the food, a little overpriced but i guess its vegas.
Never had an issues with service either. 100% will be back.
I walked in and placed an order to go:
The first time I visited the HK Kitchen I was not impressed by any means with their food but the dinning area was very clean and the staff were friendly. I even said to myself that I would not return. What a liar I turned out to be. In the mood for soup and house lo mein all while trying to stay within a five mile radius, I decided to return to the HK Kitchen. It is literally two minutes away from my house, walking distance no less. 
They basically dumped our food on the table and then ignored us. We even had to literally get up and get our waiter for a bill when we were done after waiting 20 minutes to see if he would come around on his own. This place wasn't busy, only 2 other tables with diners at them. there was no reason for the bad sevice except the waiter was more interested in his cell phone then serving his customers. 
Egg Rolls
With nearly identical menus and service, I was having a hard time finding something interesting, meaningful, and most importantly funny to say about any of these places. It was starting to cramp my style, and I feared that Chinese food would prove to be the knight that slayed the mighty Jetta Dragon. 
Golden Gate reminds me of Chinese in the Midwest, only ignorant people would rate this 4 stars. That this placed has existed at this location for many years shows there is no accounting for taste. 
- Peking duck (this was the highlight of our meal)
Problem here is, these guys may be from NY, but just like all the other "NY based" restaurants, they have to uphold the norm in the city they are in.  Scottsdale isn't a cheap place, nor a cultured place for that matter.  So to actually market themselves as a NY Authentic Restaurant isn't going to work much around here.  
Everything tasted good and fresh, the waiter was fast and attentive, good prices. Will be back again.
I've eaten here many times in the past and the seafood is always consistent. Most of the patrons are Asian so that's a great thing. 
I am so excited to have this place so close to my house! Finally decided to give it a shot after driving by on my way to Target all the time. 
I've never been a PF Chang's fan.  I like maybe one dish: the fried calamari, which is pretty hard to screw up anywhere you go.  I went recently because of a business dinner.
The worst thing，we ordered a lobster，30$ per lb，they said they have last one and over 3lbs，but when we saw the labster，it seems only half of 3lbs，I ate labster everywhere，this is horrible cheating us. They stole our money！Fuck！
Combination Fried Rice 
I happen to think Phoenix food in general is pretty darn swell and in my white girl opinion, I also happen to think that iKitchen's food is wonderfully delicious. 
great food at perfectly reasonable, order-at-the-counter prices. they've got all the normal stuff on the menu, plus some nice surprises like lettuce wraps. i've now visited 3 times in a week. lunch specials are large and cheap and for 50 cents more you can get brown rice instead of white rice. i can't understand it, but in phx it is beyond impossible to find a decent, quick chinese restaurant that serves brown rice. the sesame chicken was made with good, white meat chicken, a bit spicy and not greasy despite being fried. the kung pao chicken is the best i've had in a very long time. again made with white meat chicken and has celery and water chestnuts in it, which i'm not used to but enjoyed. and finally the hot and sour soup, complete with shrimp and beef, mushrooms, bamboo shoots was beyond amazing. i love a good hot and sour soup when i'm sick and i just happen to be sick right now. cleared out my sinuses no problem and was tasty too.
Dim Sum trio was a straight up ripoff... I'm sorry, but if we knew THREE (yes, 3) dumplings would have costed us $18.88, we probably wouldn't have ordered them.  Said dumplings were also very run of the mill in quality and flavor.  
It's quick, not over priced and not over cooked. I'm willing to try it again.
my favorite place to eat chinese food on my lunch break :) General Tso & house special chicken, yum!! friend service too
So since then, we've never been back and never will. This place is good for the lunch specials but the company isn't gonna get our money no more.
Very Slow service, be prepared to wait for at least 25-30mins for your food.It's a family run business, the husband cooks in the kitchen. The wife is the only waitress. That explains it all.  The price for seafood is awesome , and pretty Authentic Chinese cooking. Warning, this restaurant looks run down, and kinda dirty. Suggest to call and order ahead, or do take out.
This place does get very busy, especially around noon on the weekends, and I have experienced many times where the wait is upwards of an hour. Its best to go as soon as they open or later in the afternoon. This place is great for groups because of the large round tables and they even have a couple private rooms to eat in. 
Overall the dishes were pretty good and lean towards the salty side.  Tonight, I had the "three cold side dishes" of pork stomach, pig ears, and tofu which were FANTASTIC.  The seasoning was perfect and the pig ears were sliced extra thin.  The second course was no.6 - live fish with peppered bean curd.  This dish was a bit on the fishy side, and while it is definitely cheap for a whole fish ($13), I would not recommend it.  Instead, try the beef noodle soup.  It is very flavorful and the meat is part fatty and part lean, just the way I like it.  It also went well with the pig ear side dish.  Finally I ended the night with the xiao long bao.  The skin was good but the meat filling was average.  
Update:  We were contacted by the manager regarding the coupon not being honored.  They said it was only for the dinner service.  Problem is, the coupon did NOT state that.  This makes it false advertising and constitutes fraud in my book.  Its called "bait and switch" draw them in with a false ad.  That only makes me feel worse about this place, can I take the one star back?
They have other "flavors" but nothing compares to the salt and pepper that they offer.
They also brought me pork wontons in chili oil to try, too. This also tasted very good and I would recommend it to others.
ive only had their tofu dish, pan fried noodles and orange chicken.  there were four of us and we had leftovers for lunch the next day. also, place was voted Las Vegas Best a few years back....
Other than that, the place is great.  It's clean with nice atmosphere, great service, and good food.
When they closed, I was in a state of depression for nearly two years!!  Until last night, when I happened upon China Chili, not my first visit, but my first SIT DOWN experience with the restuarant.  I do what I have done at every chinese restaurant since Silver Dragon... I opened the menu and went directly to the noodle dishes to see if they offered "Singapore Rice Noodle".  Much to the delight of my stomach, they did and it was EXACTLY the same as I remember it at Silver Dragon.
Definitely check it out if you're ever around the area!
And who knows, you may even see a local celebrity. ;)
It was back to Lillie's to introduce friends to its fine Asian cuisine, and get in a quick dinner before seeing "West Side Story" at the Smith Center.  
Just go here. Now. The wonton soup alone is freaking amazing.
We tried eating the food but it was just like trying to fry water, it's a YIKES and Eeks! Methinks not!
The food did taste authentic but boring at best!---I guess that it is a cultural thing, and I need to get culturalized!  I did get tested for ---(never mind!), anyway, the culture turned out negative!---lol
There are smaller lunch combos for a very cheap prices--cheaper even than going to Panda Express which is relative garbage. For dinner, you can get a "Large" which is just white rice and entree, or you can get the "Combo" which is fried rice, entree, egg roll, and cream cheese wontons. Look, maybe a better semantic strategy was in order, but they do what they can.
+Good price for portions
I love this place I have been here a 1000 times and always the same service. I live about 5 miles away. Here where I lived are several Chinese places but non of them cook as these guys. I love this restaurant. I have been a loyal costumer for 10 years and probably be there for 10 more.
I have been going here since I was a kid...15 years later and it is still one of my favorite places to eat...GREAT service GREAT food...everybody I know LOVES wongs!
Kids meal is only $4 and even though they don't list Orange Chicken on it that is what they let her order.  She loved it and it wasn't spicy even though the menu indicates that it is.
Will not be back.
I'm sure there are other better Chinese options off the strip, but Red 8 is a solid Chinese bet if you're stuck on the Vegas strip without a car to get to decent Asian places in Vegas.
The exceptional location can't be beat - upscale dining right behind the Bellagio fountains? It's kind of hard to think of a single thing to be upset about in an atmosphere like that. AND they pipe in the music from the fountains, so you can enjoy the show without standing outside forever.
Since moving the portions have shrunk, the prices have risen and the quality also has slipped.
Always excellent food, atmosphere could use an update.  Service tends to be slow and the waitresses can be very moody at times.  It seems that service and ambience are not a priority.
My family and I love this resturant. We have been going here for years and have never been disappointed. Food is always delicious and the service is good. We love the sweet & sour chicken and mongolian beef combo plates. If you want good food in a relaxed atmosphere this is the place to go.
This place is not good. If you're Asian you will not like this place and think this place is very Western. The owners clearly cater to the White clientele of the area. Nothing here is authentic. For example I was served Pringles with my salt and pepper calamari. 
I always use the on-line ordering. Simple and easy. Cuts down on wait time. I dig their thai curry soup. Nice and zesty.
I really liked the entree, which was Kung Pao Vegetables with brown rice ($9.95). There was a great variety of veggies and peanuts, and the sauce reminded me of a curry. I did not like the dried chili peppers because I'm not a fan of super-spicy foods, so unless you can handle heat, leave them off.
And they only accept cash payment，so that they can avoid tax！ I hope IRS could check！
The prices are so inexpensive  for such quality/quantity/service, it will keep you coming back for more.  You have to try the crab puffs...pork fried rice.. and orange chicken.. they are to die for!!
The best orange chicken I've had in Az! 
Took a little longer than we expected to get our food, but maybe they had a lot of deliveries that night.  I had a very delicious, BIG plate of chow fun for $8.  My wife ordered the egg foo young dinner special and she enjoyed it too.
You eat at one chin chin, you eat at all Chins. It is your typical chain restaurant quality- more expensive than you'd want to shell out, but the food isn't horrible so you don't stay away. 
I met a few friends for happy hour and dinner here, and was pleasantly surprised by my experience. I like Chinese food, but I have never been a big fan of P.F. Changs because there as never been a dish there that stood out to me and made me want to go back, so I was interested to see what Jimmy Woo's had to offer. 
To sum it up, go for the stuff you can't get in a regular above average Chinese restaurant. 
P.S. -- I've been once more since my first visit -- I took my son, who isn't really a Chinese fan, but he got the Moo Goo Gai Pan and LOVED it.
This was an amazing restaurant:
Love this place!! I'm a Chinese food whore i swear i could eat it every day! Anyway i am absolutely obsessed with their won ton soup.. This shit is SOO good.. Seriously. Best soup i have ever had. i want some right now just thinking about it. Everything we got was right on point as well.. Some chicken wings, lo mien, Mongolian beef  and my b/f is in love with their fried rice( have to admit it is pretty scrumptious)everything was delicious. Decent prices.. You can order for takeout, they deliver as well or you can eat in. inside is nothing special, but they are quick and the food is excellent.. Highly recommend!
I can't believe this place has been around for four years (as of this writing), and I've only just now discovered it.  If you haven't discovered it yet, do yourself a favor and order yourself some Bourbon Chicken asap.
Quibbles? A few times that I've visited there has been a rather obnoxious front of house/floor manager whose sole purpose seems to have been being concurrently flippant to customers and rude to the sterling waiting staff. Less of him please.
Overall I would say the price really is the biggest drawback. Between myself and my wife I spent more than I would for a dinner at The Melting Pot (Granted, this is more food for sure).  Since it was planned as our "Expensive Dinner" before the show I knew what I was getting into, but I would never just "Stop in" here for a meal.
The Sesame Chicken was fried cutlets with a sauce dripped over. Not only were the pieces of chicken dry, but half of it did not have sauce on it. 
The food was pretty good. The only thing I didn't care for was the fried rice. It was pretty bland and tasteless. 
Not only that, they deliver! For about the same price as Panda and at a higher quality, I will choose Shangri La far more often than other fast food chinese. 
Granted I probably could go into Chinatown and get good cheap food, but I always end up sticking to the hotels trying to find that great Dim Sum restaurant on the Strip. 
There are other places to waste your money.
I cannot believe I have to resort to THIS as my Asian food now. I'm sorry family, San Gabriel Valley (that's in Los Angeles, CA by the way), I have failed you guys.
All-in-all, the Emperors Garden is full of weeds.   As they would say in Chinese, this place is Boo Hao (bad!)
We each got a cup of soup--me hot and sour and wonton for my wife.  These were the standouts of my order.  We also got two complimentary egg rolls.  They give one with a purchase of a certain amount and I guess since we got two dinners, we got two egg rolls.
I also but down into what I think was a clump of dirt or sand which was gross and the texture and grains lingered a bit, very surprising.
General Tso's is my go to dish for Chinese take out, an this place failed miserably on that! Nothing but over cooked chicken with a lot of sauce and breading and yucky skin. Yuck.
For all the people that like noodles, your gonna fall in love with them here! Totally hand made and if your lucky you'll get to see them make it first hand like we did. They bang, stretch, pull, toss, twirl, and cut it right in front of you. What an experience to watch while waiting for your food. Very friendly service and the owner is willing to recommend dishes describing the way it's prepared. Listen carefully she is very soft spoken. Wether your in the mood for tossed noodles or noodle soup you can't go wrong. Just remember to try the cut noodles and the pork and chive pot-stickers are the best I've ever had. I wish they had one in SF.
The slap-not really worth going out of your way for.
Alash a cheating waitress drove away future customer business...what a shame!
We ended up with an order of Shrimp and Vegetables, Kung Pao Chicken, and Honey Chicken. While it didn't say it on the menu, every meat item was breaded. And since the shrimp and kung pao chicken hadn't been fried, the breading was sort of falling off. I'll admit that the shrimp looked a little unappetizing. I don't know if you can order them with out the breading, but should we return, I'll be asking. The only other issue is just an issue with my tastebuds. I happen to hate water chestnuts and it seemed like each item was filled with them. The white rice was okay, but the brown rice seemed to have been really overcooked. The only item that I'd order again would be the Honey Chicken. Not overly sauced, still crispy, and definitely flavorful. But seeing as I was trying to be healthy by ordering the Shrimp and Vegetables of their Wok Lite menu, it's sort of counterproductive.
The setting was clean. It looked clean and it felt clean. The restroom was clean. There was ample parking spaces in the outdoor strip mall. But the restaurant was a stand alone building.
i really like china wok. like other reviewers have said, it is just average chinese food that delivers.
Can't call ahead and ask, because nobody is there.  
The food served at Golden Harvest is amazing, taking the price and variety into consideration.
 On top of that, at 6 pm every evening, you can even watch them actually make the noodles in the middle of the restaurant as you dine.
Bring your own water or buy something to drink... their water tastes gross...
I expected more from this place but the food is just your basic frozen food cooked in a wok...or microwave. I will say that my wife the lemon chicken and it tasted like it was cooked, left out, and then reheated, you know it had that "reheated" taste. 
The best hot and sour soup this side of town. Their egg foo young Cantonese style is unbeatable and their moshu is fantastic. The only thing I think could be improved is their egg rolls sort of taste like out of the box not. Homemade.
The service is just a little friendlier than a Chinatown diner. But they are strict about waiting to be seated! IF you seat yourself, they may call you out on it! There is a bar you can eat at and watch the cooks, or plenty of tables where you can watch the gamblers and those freezing waitresses. 
Crab Rangoon leaves something to be desired, but the other food made up for it. Rice was hot, fresh, and delicious. :)
This place is great!  I have not had a dish that I did not love.
I didn't even get to eat. Walked in, stood there for a few minutes, nobody said anything. One of the employees looked right at us and didn't help at all or tell someone else to help us. All in all, we sat there for 5 minutes at the host stand and nobody helped us so we walked out. Good luck to the next person.
The strange and small assortment of items left us not wanting to return, and we didn't.
Prices are a bit high for quick chinese food, but i guess its vegas..... Overall will definitely come back here when i wanna kill myself from being hungover and in need of a soup!
rice n noodle is like an extension of my kitchen. i get food here if i dont have time to cook. orders come out really fast. customer service is tops. my daughter loves their honey walnut prawns, its not like what we're used to coming from san francisco but its the closest!
OK, I don't know why, but this place has several names depending on which website you visit.  Currently it is called Karen's Unicorn, and the food and service are impeccable. We ended up here as all of the rest of the Stephan St. establishments were closed after 10:00 PM.  Truly a Stockbridge gem if there is one. Outstanding Chinese food with perfect service.  
In for an early lunch. Restaurant was clean & employees were polite, but seemed incapable of producing a smile.
I would say like any take out, there is hit/miss but with these prices I'd say to give it a try and navigate some of the recommendations on other reviews.
The staff is super nice and always go over your order to make sure you receive the items you requested.
Great lunch prices!
Never again. I've ordered from here for a few years and the food was pretty good before the new management. I had food delivered and the order was wrong (as it had been a few times in the past). I called to see if they would correct it, and not only did the man I spoke to not offer to replace my order, he told me I was wrong. He argued with me for about 10 minutes as to why I was wrong. He was rude, dismissive, and ended the call saying "Whatever" and hung up on me. The food isn't that great and after that horrible service, I'll never go back there!
Overall I was really happy with the quality, quantity, and the service that was given to me!
A dear friend recommended this fine dining establishment,
Unlike George & Sons
Our soup was cold at this place and the server was not the friendliest either.
The portions were okay (except for the rice on the side), but who cares -- since the food was lame?
Having said that, if i lived close by i would order take out and save a bunch.
The downsides to me are the varying hours... I'm not a fan of "open until
Noodle Asia is already open until 2am, but I wish they were open even later for post-clubbing drunken dining.  But I guess the chefs need to sleep sometime...
Sesame chicken seemed to be the overall winner.
I was trying place a delivery order and WOW the person on the phone couldn't even speak english!!!!  How am I supposed to order food if they can't even understand what I am saying.  I'm not tyring to be racist, but come on!  Get someone that can speak English and understand English to take the order!!!  I repeated my phone number and my address 10 times and she still coudn't get it!!  I even spelled it out and she still couldn't get it!!!!  Please put someone on the phone that speaks English!
If I'm going to get what we Americans call "Chinese food' - this is not the place. 
They accept credit cards and delivery was pretty speedy.  They told me by phone 45 minutes and actually were there within 25 minutes.  So sooner than I thought it would be.
Cons: The chicken in the chicken fried rice. As far as the rice went, it was great. Full of flavor. The chicken was meh. Lots of dark marks and lots of pieces attached by a thin string of fat.
Oh, and you may wish to bring your own silverware. The utensils they have just might be the cheapest, flimsiest, plastic you will ever eat from. The knives were not strong enough to slice through my chicken. And, they are the sized for children's hands. 
The Hot and Sour soup is perfection. The right balance of heat and sour. The steamed dumplings were moist and tasty. I do wish the sauce that comes with it has more spice. The food tastes fresh, nice textures and plenty to pick from on the menu. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is they don't deliver. It's still worth the short drive tho!
It's served a number of ways, but I usually go for the black bean sauce style. Then, I eat like nobody's watching, vow to never let my boyfriend see me like this, and usually end up getting sauce on my face, clothing, table, neighbors, etc. Go messy, or go home.
We tried the sushi and the cooked kitchen menu items. It was all just a mess. Their entrees (i.e. General Tso Chicken, Singapore Noodles) are priced in the $20-30+ range and taste much worse in quality as Panda Express (which I could call gourmet compared to this place).  The sushi rolls are relatively creative on paper, and then I would like you to imagine placing rancid old raw fish into your mouth. What they call "belly tuna" might have looked like belly tuna but I was fooled (shame on me). I will almost take responsibility for ordering belly tuna when it seemed way too good to be true.
The prices seem to be in the average for the Chinese food industry here in Vegas.
My coworkers and I ate here for lunch yesterday. It wasn't great, wasn't really good either. But it was okay because we were hungry and we are all broke girls so we ate it anyway.
I will be returning.  The food is good.  I will just try and stay away from the egg rolls.
THE WARNING HERE IS HE SERVES  MINORS ON PURPOSE! He seems to cater to the younger crowd....under 21! Kinda creepy!
We have eaten here a couple of times.  Is it gourmet Chinese food as the sign proclaims?  Maybe if your definition of gourmet is different then mine. The service is ok.  Some of the people are really bubbly and others are not appearing to be very customer oriented.  If you get the teriyaki chicken breast it is tasty and you get a bunch of it.  The egg rolls are nasty.  It is not just this location, but every Panda location.  For a quick bite to eat this place suffices.  Nothing special.  The parking lot is pretty clean, usually the inside is pretty clean.  My wife likes Panda more than I do.  I suppose if it were not for her that I may not eat here at all.
I have been eating at this establishment since the mid 90's when I worked just around the corner on Via De Ventura.
Teriyaki chicken was also good, lots of meat, chicken tender, not too much sugary flavor. 
So for what it is, it's convenient and decent. 
Discard Pile~2.5
I went here a couple weeks ago and got the sesame chicken.  I was disappointed when I saw that it wasn't chunks of chicken, but a boneless piece of chicken that was breaded, fried, and then sliced into strips.  The sauce wasn't that good anyway.  I won't be back.
But the food is the best part. It is on the Americanized side but you are eating Chinese food in Phoenix, AZ. It's hard for me to get anything other then the Mongolian there which is incredible. Most people get it with Pork, but it is also awesome with their deep-fried tofu. They also have awesome spring rolls, but they aren't quite as good as they were when they were China Gate.
Chinese food was different because most families could not make it at home unless they used those nasty supermarket brand La Choy products that made you want to misbehave so mom would send you to bed without supper.
I noticed the portion size from eat-in/take out was different. When you eat in, it seems like you get twice as much food, so note taken.. Food was awesome.. oh, and the chicken I ordered last time wasn't called Wonderful chicken, but " Amazing Chicken", hehe.. either way said, it was good...
It's very very very bland. I'm speechless at how mediocre the food is here. The noodles are indeed hand made and taste very fresh but there is almost zero flavor with any of the food they offered in their large menu. And I'm not some white dude judging Eastern food from a Western palate. I love Chinese food. At it's worst, Chinese food can at least be salty. This food lacked anything. It was like eating nothing. They brought out sriracha and everyone at our table used copious amounts of it to add anything to it.
9.  Pepper Beef Ribs - The flavor was ok, but some of the beef was a little more rare than we like
The new space is much larger and I think the kitchen struggles to keep up. The quality of the food is not what it used to be, but Chinese is like pizza- even bad pizza is still good- and China Chili is the same way. The Szechuan green beans were disappointing- they were much too salty. The Mongolian chicken and the hot and spicy prawns are awesome, though. Those two dishes alone almost redeem the restaurant for any other misgiving I ever had about the place. 
I so wanted to like Hong Fu Noodle.  
Staff was attentive, helpful and friendly.
No M.S.G
They have the same selections as all the other chinese places...except they all taste better! We have been going here for the last two years and they are consistently awesome! Great food and they always end up giving us free eggrolls with our order. FREE EGGROLLS! I love this place.
     But the made to order food is pretty decent.  The menu lists each dish's protein, veggie and what sauce it comes with.   ) which really helps because the have a large menu.
The place is filthy. The staff is rude or service is slow and they act like they really do not want to be there. 
OMG!  The worst Chinese take out in town.  I ordered Sun Devil Chicken & Chicken lo mien.  Well the chicken was chewy.  Icky.v In fact I gagged.  Its was liked rubber.  My daughters also thought the chicken was nasty.  Never again.  Eww!
Crab Puffs: These were the biggest let down of the whole meal. The outside was tasty and fried to perfection, but the inside tasted like straight cream cheese. I'm pretty sure there was no crab in these at all. I'm guessing it was just a one-time type mistake or something.
I love Chinese food and have had a hard time finding a great place since Far East closed! China Grill is delicious! The portion sizes are large....you get your moneys worth that is for sure! Not only do you get large portions, the quality is above the rest. I highly recommend the China Grill!!
I walked out with a 40 dollar tab for 2 and i was terribly disappointed, the only reason i had even gone was because of the reviews :(
Pretty decent chinese food for the strip.
I WATCHED AS A COUPLE OF YOUNGER GUYS WALKED IN AND WERE NOT CARDED BUT INSTEAD GIVEN SAMPLES OF THESE "SPECIAL" DRINKS.
Clean, tasty menu, cheap, friendly, and a new business in the SW oh yea I'll be back definitely. They have a Spicy Honey Chicken dish which looks good, from the pics posted, and I do want to try more of their menu. They do deliver for orders at least $15 and within 3 miles and they also take orders online which always good.
Beef Skewers - TO DIE FOR! That is all that needs to be said.
The food is pretty good. Pretty authentic. Sichuan cuisine (this is the right Chinese way to spell Szechuan) is known for their spiciness, the numbing spiciness. This is the only Chinese restaurant I have been to in Phoenix that offers the real numbing spiciness. Love it! 
Service was attentive, fast and friendly, even during a busy time.
Choice of Peameal Canadian Back Bacon or Honey-Glazed Slab Bacon
A side note; the fish in the fish tank creep me out. They are Huge and way too large to enjoy life in the small tank... Just saying.
Prices are pretty good (really good if you hit it weekdays for lunch special - and lunch special includes General Tso's Chicken for fans of that! That's pretty rare. If I was a Tso fan, I'd double bonus point that - but, as you can tell - I'm a duck fan: so only single bonus points there.
   Fish Fillet with Black Bean Sauce
- Har gow, shrimp dumplings 
While visiting Las Vegas, my husband and I had a craving for Chinese food, but we were not familiar with the area so we decided to yelp for a  Chinese restaurant  and came up with this restaurant.   At first we were hesitant to go to a restaurant with the name express, because most of the time express means cheap and quick food.  We decided to take the chance anyways and was not disappointed.  The food was very good and the service was not bad at all, maybe because it wasn't  too busy when we were there but anyways we got our food on time and our glasses of water was constantly refilled.  Over all I really love this place.. we will be back soon.
   The Pork Fried Rice had all the right ingredients but was dry and devoid of the smoky infusion only a properly hot wok can impart.
Its highly unlikely you'll find fresh, hand-pulled noodles (complete with a show) outside the Las Vegas Strip or your nearby Panda Express for that matter. That combined with Beijing Noodle Cafe's prices, they can't be beat. Sure they have the typical anglicized Chinese food suspects here as well, but they obviously shine through with their noodle dishes, and boy do they hit the mark. 
Being from NY and used to my corner store Chinese food, paying prices such as $9 for egg drop soup is difficult. Hotel food is down right horrible.
Food was average.
If you like fish, for less than approximately 1/7 of the price of the fresh (swimming) fish, order the sea bass tofu clay pot. The fish is lightly fried and stewed in clay pot. This is my favorite dish. My other new discovery thanks to my less adventurous nephew is the fried chicken. Mmmm...fried chicken.
Can't say I will be running back to Gourmet House of Hong Kong, but not a place I would avoid either.
Been going there for years, my parents favorite. The food is quite good, a bit too American for me but OK. Service is good, lady owner is very friendly and she will remember you. Decor is a bit old and rooms are a bit dark, they should freshen it up a bit. Moo shu pork is my favorite, veggie dish is good, boo boo platter is OK.
I went with the Orange Chicken (typical right?), Fried Rice, and Hot n Sour Soup from the 5.75 list. Keep in mind a drink is not included but I got water and it was definitely from their tap.
The Good - Orange Chicken.  It was standard issue.
Just awesome. I've spent a long time looking for consistently and legitimately delicious Asian food in Madison and I think I've finally found it in Dumpling Haus. It's not your typical beef-and-broccoli take-out by any means, instead focusing entirely on noodle soup and dumplings, mainly bao. The steamed dumplings here are without a doubt the best that I have ever had, and the noodles are almost up there. My one complaint is that they don't have many items on the menu that aren't filled with pork, making it difficult (but still enjoyable) to eat kosher or halal in here.
One of the few Chinese restaurants that I'd recommend in Phoenix.  It has proven time and time again to be consistently good.  Its a bit more on the expensive side for Chinese food (but you have to understand that I usually demand cheap good eats), but overall I think the food is worth the slight premium.  Especially since its one of the few restaurants that is actually located in Northeast Phoenix opposed to Chandler or the Westside.  
It is located on the North side of the road and the entrance could be easy to miss.
Now when your in China Town in NYC (Lafayette st, Canal St, Centre St.) that is more Authentic They Serve you family style with Large round table, its usually a 3-5 course dinner. (the service is excellent and the food is not greasy. ) Im sure there is some added flavors that Us American like on certain dishes but for the most part it way better that the Corner spots. Every New Yorker i met all say the same thing.. Why does the chinese taste horrible here. I thought it was me, I Even asked a few Chinese friends i have here and they suggested heading to China town area on Sprint Mtn ave. So i Go There and its the same. Now the Only Place i found where its New York Style food is China-A- Go-Go.  Now  FYI  Know your noodles, they do not make "Lo-Mein" Noodles that we are used to on the east coast.
Beijing has got all of these easily covered...I was introduced to Beijing just over a year ago and will not consider any other place when looking for good Chinese food. Consistent with most restaurants in NYC, this "New York" style Chinese restaurants sits in a little hole in the wall that you'd drive right past if you weren't looking. Do not let their appearance dissuade you. This place is legit!! 
Went there today with my kids the manager was so rude and could careless what the food looks or tastes like. The teriyaki chicken is always burnt after they chop it up they leave the scraps on the counter.  I went to use the restroom only to discover that the toilet would not flush thank goodness I only had to pee! When I mentioned it to the manager she just shrugged it off. This place is an embarrassment to our neighborhood! !
I ordered pork fried rice, Mongolian beef and shrimp and snow peas. Got free crab puffs with my order. 
dim sum!!!!
Since this is the first listing to pop up when searching for a Chinese restaurant in Vegas, we just HAD to try it out. We went to get take-out to bring to eat with others so I'm basing the service and food on the experience I had from that. First of all, there's nothing 'express' about this place. It's a sit-down restaurant, not a 'scoop food' place. There is also a location inside the Palace Station hotel.
We liked Li's Bowl, but were not wow'ed by our experience.  It is a nice local take out joint, with decent food and good portions/pricing.  The service was fast and friendly. We had some sushi rolls and a couple of their combo meals.  Again, good but not great.    It wasn't anything super-spectacular, but we enjoyed it enough and would probably go there again if we had an immediate Chinese food take out craving.
I have been here several times and love the food! I happily eat the ma po tofu every time:) We went for dinner and tried the crispy green beans...they were crunchy and came with a yummy dipping sauce...must try!
Far from traditional, but that's not what you're here for (traditional can be found on Spring Mountain, the chinatown plaza). Portions are huge, the grease is great for building up the required barrier in your stomach required for heavy drinking! Will definitely be back for more when we're back in town in November.
We also tried the potstickers $5.95 for 6. Again these were fine, but not outstanding. 
1st time my wife and I got food here it was ok..we ordered egg roll which was horrible, definitely not New York style..We also ordered beef and brocolli which was just ok. The second time we went there my wife ordered chicken mein fun when we got home she immedietly got sick. This New Yorker won't be going back..I'm not going to spend another night cleaning up my wife's vomit.
Joyful is a great place to go for some good Chinese food. It's located in a small shopping center along with a dry cleaners, a gas station and a few other mom and pop places. 
My girlfriend and I found ACE upon arriving in Mesa for a temporary work assignment of about 6 months.  We love this place.  If you're looking for fancy, this ain't it!  But if you're looking for a clean, decent, VERY inexpensive Chinese restaurant with good food and friendly service, this is the place!  It's in a strip mall right next to a Subway deli if that gives you an idea of the ambiance.  It's usually full of Asian people which is always a good sign to me.  There are zillions of items on the menu, and while we've only tried a few of them, we have yet to try something that we didn't think was delicious.  The Beef Chow Fun with gravy is my favorite, but we also like the Chicken with Fresh and Black Mushrooms.  Sit down, or take out, you can't lose in this place.
Have to change my mind here.
The manager did nothing but argue and tells us we ordered wrong and that we did not get the shrimp fried rice free because we ordered a family special and that the house fried rice does not come with the family special when it clearly states that on there website.
I love the Mongolian beef! I no longer live close by but will go out of my way sometimes on my way home from work to pick up an order to go.
I keep coming back here.  The food has always been excellent quality.  The value for the lunch specials is second to none.  You can get a huge lunch portion for under $6 and it is really good.  It's actually enough food for an entire second meal.  Definitely try this if you haven't yet.
needed to a get a quick meal and chinnise sounded good this was close by and the prices were quite right lunch starting at 3.99 for a full lunch egg roll. rice, soup and main..food was good for the price and were quick with parparing things and having it ready for take out. will return and try something new..
FYI, there is a small seating area here but it is mainly a takeout place.
- The Curries - Bangkok & Singapore are really good! I usually get the Chicken or Beef and a side of brown rice. Much better then the local Thai restaurants who serve Curries. 
It seems they always have coupons in the local mailers for 15% off. 
I still have a lot more to explore and if I come across something I like, I'll be sure to edit my review.  I always leave with my to go cup of 3 bean drink.  They have a lot of dessert that I need try.  Every visit though, everyone is too full to share with me :(  I'll be back, so I'll try to just eat the desserts by myself!
It's apparent that their client base is mostly repeat customers since they seem to know almost everyone that walks through their doors. That says a lot about their food and their service. This place is the real deal.
Spring Rolls
We ordered: Plum Wine - Delicious!
Quick service is what they serve in the place. They have great food...but in my opinion just a little overpriced, but then again...I feel like most Asian restaurants are in AZ. The waiter is super friendly and always has a smile on her face. 
I don't understand everyone else's dislike of this place. I've ordered to-go and delivery from this establishment for two years and have never had an issue. Food is good, prices are reasonable and customer service has always been perfect. 
 Oh Right, the prices are extremely reasonable for qulity of food and level of service.
Wow!  We found this place on Yelp when another nearby restaurant was closed.  We will be back for sure.  We had the crab puffs, the Indonesian fried rice and the braised beef in curry.  Everything was excellent.  The braised beef in curry was incredibly tender and tasty.
The only remaining advantage is delivery if you happen to be in the Cent Pho area, though their minimum order for delivery is now $15, and I think a charge applies.
Decent Chinese takeout or delivery in Middleton.
I have had better buffets and better Chinese food but it was OK. The price I later learned does not include your drink, which I think in all fairness it should. They have a few deserts and soft serve ice cream but I passed on the sweets. My favorite was the fried butterfly shrimp, they were tender, meaty and tasty - had 5 of them. The chow mien was a little greasy but still tasty. Sampled some chicken dish that was also tasty but since nothing is labeled to tell you what it is called it's hard to know. 
Since Big Wong closed, I heard that Peter Wong (her brother's place) is fairly similar but I don't think they even come close. When I arrived for dinner, I noticed the decor was very dated. They still had decoration up from the 80s. There was also a mini stage available for wedding, if anyone is interested. 
Food:
I smiled politely and nodded.   What I had here on my plate was the same as mom used to make, tin-y limp and bland ...and the egg roll was filled with the same chop suey-ness that was going on in my plate.  The think cornstarch thickened sweet and sour sauce and plenty of  soy made it a bit better.  The 2 fried shrimp were a bit tough but again with sweet and sour sauce it made them ok.   By the time I began to try my egg fu young, knew I was going to need a bit more to make it work.  I motioned for the server and asked if they had chile sauce and she promptly brought me some.  
Don't have time to read about the 'history' of this place, but I guess they've been around awhile.  I see why. 
I've been going to Flo's for years.  Chinese food can be hit or miss.  We decided to give it a try one day when she had her old resturant across the street from where she is now.  The food was awesome.  It didn't take long before word caught on and she had to open a bigger place.    Her food at this location is excellent (although I've tried some of her resurants and they are not as good) and she is usually there working.  Lunch menu is a great value and so is happy hour.  It is always busy, so go early.  Never had a bad meal or experience.  The only negative, it gets very loud in the dining room.
We went here and order: general tso chicken nice balance of sweet and spicy, Hunan beef spicy and full of flavor, beef lo mein plenty of beef and noodles, egg rolls were crispy and not dried out cabbage like most places, fried shrimp perfectly cooked not dried out, mushu pork most authentic ones I've had since leave California over 20 years ago! So far this has been our big favorite of all the Chinese food places we've been to! Yes its americanized but no disrespect to other who like real Chinese food out of China but I've been to those places and wasn't impressed or like it much so I'll keep my americanized versions!!!
Ewww! Stay far away from this place! What kind of Chinese food is this! Defintely not from Hawaii or San Fransisco! What happened  to the taste? Not good at all!
Two stars for the guy who served our table. He was nice.
I think I'll try the boba tea and a different entrée next time, hopefully there is something better on the menu.
We had Hot & Sour soup, and were asked if we wanted it spicy; we did; it was. Really quite excellent, among the best Hot & Sour I've had. Very rich and full, I was surprised at the shrimp and chicken, which were perfect in texture and taste; the veggies were just the right crispness, the broth was spicy but not too hot, and all in all I really recommend this soup; my companion said it was his favorite part of the meal. He's from rural North Carolina and had never had it before, nor much Chinese. As for me, I'd come back for more.
Try to Hakka Noodles, duck salad, beef rib chunks, all of which were amazing! Service was very attentive and knowing that I was hungry.. they rushed orders and didn't make us wait like every other fancier restaurant.
Ordered the set dinner for 2. Opting for spicy tofu in place of the beef with black bean. Everything was very tasty and nothing was over/under seasoned which is a pleasant change from some of the other takeout I've had! I believe they are also MSG free which is a major major bonus in my books!
Outstanding service and great food. Enough said.
The food was delivered very quick.  It was very fresh tasting - which isn't always the case when you order Chinese food!  Very close by so I am very sure I will order from here again :)
Not a bad place to eat at all, especially considering the limited options for tolerable Chinese food around UNLV.
The food was cold and overcooked. I'll never be back. A waste of 7 hard earned dollars.  Should have asked for my money back. 
My boyfriend and I just bought a house a few minutes away and we were looking for the best local Chinese place for us to settle into and OH. MY. GOD. did we hit the jackpot.
spicy pork wontons - 3 stars, was just ok.  just a hint of spice.  was expecting more flame.
Food came out quickly and the service was very prompt and to the point which I liked.
I saw Wong's because I drove through the area and noticed two cops having a conversation in their cruisers in the parking lot. Their sign was well-lit in the corner and I had never noticed it before, so I went it. I was very pleased to see an actual Chinese restaurant instead of one out of a million buffets or Panda Express-like shops. They do take-out, which was great for me being on a schedule. I figured I would try something simple, so I went with their Shrimp Fried Rice.
When you first walk in this place you'll notice how clean it is.  For me personally, that's a big deal.  I hate going into places that stink or look like they haven't cleaned in weeks.
This blows our former favorite sushi joint in D.C. out of the water!  
This is the best value in Las Vegas after a 2-year search. And I did Yelp extensively, regularly, and frequently to get the best reviews.
When my clay-pot arrived the pot was large and contained pieces of chicken with bones, large black mushrooms, veggies and flavored rice. On the side they give you  sauce for additional saltiness - The flavor was delish and really satisfying. 
I have mentioned this before, but I'm a New York Jew. I also have "Chinese Food" listed as my religion in my facebook profile. And I love this place.
Fin is a Chinese restaurant, but it is probably a more Americanized interpretation (based on what we had here).  They were doing a $40 3-course special.  There was a good variety of starters to choose from while there was not much selection among the entrees or the desserts.  We all opted for the 3-course.  We added some a la carte dishes to share as well.
 - Normally i dont like eggplant but this place's spicy eggplant might just change my mind. A nice sized plate of eggplant perfectly seasoned and not too spicy with slivers of onion and bamboo shoots. Chinese eggplant with skin on. Texture was spot on, not too soggy or slimy and had a firm bite to it. 
We ordered our usual dishes, and they were still pretty good! The only disappointment was the cold noodles: They were pretty flavorless, and completely different from before. But the Chongqing Chicken (Bone-In) was still crispy and flavorful! However, the portion was much smaller than in the past. Another favorite of ours is the stir-fried green pepper potato strips, which didn't disappoint. Overall a solid spot to go for some authentic Szechwan cuisine.
Singapore Noodles ($10)- pretty good. Decent curry flavor and was generous with toppings of shrimp, chicken and bbq pork. 
Decent food, decent prices, and locally owned.
i'll start off by saying it was my fault for getting chinese in phoenix. but a senior in my office was heading there, so of course i had to go. the food is standard chinese/cornstarch fare, though i'm sure there is a saving chef's specialty dish.
I have eaten here at least 10 times and never had a sub-par experience so I would have to say they are very consistent.  The only thing they have done consistently that I have laughed about is that they always forget to give me a pen to sign the check with.  When I ask for a pen, they always say "not again".  Oh well.  I am never in a hurry near 3am.
Price: TOOOO Much for Asian food. 
It would be a one star review if the waitress wasn't trying exceptionally hard to be friendly.
Bad Chinese food fast!
I have been here several times now and have never found it to be busy.  The service is one of the best with the owner or manager occasionally coming out to talk to you personally about the food.
Lo mein has a very weird taste.  Not sure why but  pretty sure I dont want to know. Crispy chicken is not crispy.  Breading is excessive and leads to a rubbery consistency.  Not coming back.  Sorry, but third time was not a charm.
The food here is pretty good. I ordered the Mongolian beef and it was delicious. It came in a pretty large serving, at least the "meal"version did. Only bad thing is that  It's located next to a smoke shop, not the best place to bring a family. I recommend ordering take out if you eat here.
Beef Chow Fun = $22
Use to come here all the time when I was living in North las vegas. Food was ok back than,  so finally I was able to drop in for the first time in 6 years. There fried rice is still good and there fried chicken still tasted the same even after all this years. Even though chai tips is not world class there food in my opinion is still decent for a hole in the wall. I will definitely be back again if im ever in the neighborhood.
We got most of the items listed in all these other reviews so I won't spout it off.  My suggestion is to bring a good orderer, someone who can order in cantonese/mandarin.   If you don't have any asian friends who can order, then PM me.    
Great authentic Chinese!
This place is awesome, I wish I found it earlier. We got the Honey Walnut Shrimp and it was AMAZING. The only complaint was that they were 15 minutes later than they said they would be, but seriously it was a Friday night and the place was packed. Which, now I see why. They included free egg rolls and crispy things in the to go order. Very generous with the rice that they gave us. I seriously plan on making this place a regular. Way worth the price. Its tucked behind starbucks.
Coming from Seattle and being used to a completely different style of Chinese food, this place was acceptable.
Oh how I miss the days when China Village was good. Don't even bother going here now. The meat is hard to chew threw, the fryer way too hot, and every dish uses the same bland brown sauce. The orange chicken was the dish I always got, but the poor thing as been reduce to a plate of grizzly, overly deep fried, dog meat with some orange sauce on top. Trust me. Don't waste your money here. I'm actually surprised they are still open!
We are not certain we will come back soon, but I give this restaurant 4 stars because of the phenomenal service.
Food was AMAZING! I had the beef with broccoli and the sauce is excellent! Sweet and sour chicken is not worth $10, but the chicken was good. Highly recommend! However delivery took over an hour..... :(
The hostesses seemed put out that we had come in and placed us at the worst possible table, right at the entrance, although there were plenty of empty tables.  It took almost 20 minutes for our waiter to show up and take our orders, and another 10 minutes to get us some water.  
Tried this place for the first time based on previous positive reviews, and I loved it! The restaurant was clean. I ordered to go. I had a lot of questions about the menu the lady didn't seem to get irritated and even helped me make a decision. Now I got the curry with chicken- spicy but soooooo tasty!!!! My boyfriend got a sweet and sour meal with chicken, pork and shrimp! Both of our meals came with fried rice which was cooked to perfection. 
Noodle Express has your regular, generic, Americanized menu of the same old Chinese food you get anywhere.   
Cloud 9.  
Very happy I found this place! 
Clean, good food and great service. Granted it's not the best chinese food in town but I haven't had any bad experiences there. My kids love the chikcen chow-mein and I'm always getting the Mongolian Beef, I am a fan
I've tried my fair share of local Chinese food and it always ends up a disappointment. China One, though not without such feelings draws me back time after time. Their food is pretty good(the only Chinese beef my hubby will eat) and you get big portions. They remember you and that makes a difference to me as a customer. Their service is friendly and cheerful. Beef Chow Fun and Shrimp Egg Fu Yung are my faves here.
Cheap menu, food is just OK. Good enough for its price. Service could be worked on.
I've ordered from this place before and I remember it being "not bad".. definitely a lot cheaper than the place closer to the house.  
My friend, who lives near 23rd Ave. & Northern in Phoenix (a mere 22 miles away), goes ONLY to Wong's Place when in the mood for Chinese food.  Wong's Place is the also only Chinese restaurant that I go to in the Valley.
I'm in Vegas not in Chinatown.  Being a Chinatown boy-- this place is a little hard for me to accept.  The food was expensive as hell.  Wonton noodle soup cost $18.. Dumplings $15... the list goes on!  I kept doing the math in my head... I could've bought 6 wonton noodle soups back home for the price of this one lousy bowl of noodles... 75 dumplings for this one plate of dumplings, etc etc.    Ok ok ok-- the noodles weren't lousy, in fact it was decent considering there weren't many authentic Chinese options in the area.  I actually even liked the decor!  They lined the entrance with huge goldfish tanks, all white interior and even a petite Chinese girl in a short skirt  at the front (I swear she's decor because she didn't speak much English).  
No idea why this place gets bad reviews. We went there at lunchtime and it was packed. We were given menus quickly and the hand pulled noodles with tomato and egg I had was wonderful. Servers were working hard but we didn't have to wait for anything. Great experience and will definitely be back on our next visit.
Luxor had provided us a $20 dollar food credit for a few of the restaurants located in this hotel. We decided to give it a go by having a light snack here at Rice and Company. We didn't have lunch or dinner reservations but we were quickly seated at one of their tables. We were greeted by their waitress who quickly brought us some water and menus to look over. We decided to order one order of the tuna roll and another of the salmon roll. Each is about $10 dollars. The rolls are super tiny but to be honest, they are pretty fresh and delicious. There is no fishy taste or smell and the sea weed that the roll is wrapped in tasted good. The atmosphere of the places is very calm and quiet. We enjoyed our rolls quickly and soon were asking for the check. Being that we had that coupon, we ended up paying less than $3 for the meal. Unfortunately being that the rolls are small and a bit on the pricer side, not sure if I would come back to have this as a normal meal. They also serve noodles and other rice dishes with Chinese food. One thing I did enjoy other than the food flavor was that even though we had a coupon, the waitress didn't make us feel bad, even after our small order she treated us with respect and friendly. Needless to say, we tipped her well.
I love this place! We first wanted to go to another restaurant but it was closed so we started driving around the area and found Grand China.  It was a delight to have lunch here.
With simple cafe-like restaurant like these, I go only for 1 thing.... Tasty food, and I got just that. Been there few times now... We've randomly ordered selection from menu, ordered some of our usual fave Chinese dishes, and staff recommendations, no complaints so far.
Service was great and food was pretty great! Will visit here the next time I'm in Phoenix again!
We tried this a a friend's recommendation, one whom had spent years living in China and FINALLY some good New York style Chinese in Vegas! You can really  tell they are buying quality ingredients, which is obvious from the generous lean white meat chicken - not "typical" chewy stuff you usually get in Vegas. Vegetables actually cooked until tender rather than rushed in the wok & still raw like other quick serve. This place is worth the 4 mile drive from my house & giving up delivery by the impostors nearby!!!!  Ordered Hot and Sour Soup which was really hot, Chicken Lo Mein and Chicken and Broccoli in brown sauce.  We plan on trying fried rice, Pepper Steak and Kung Pao next time.  Only downfall is getting the staff better trained.
Aside from the price, noodle Asia is actually pretty legit Chinese food on the strip, which is hard to come by.  Usually at other major hotels, you get all the ching chong ling long bells and whistles with big gigantic dragons and red and gold walls everywhere and bastardized noodles.  Rest assured this place actually feels like a classy hole in the wall.  I'm not sure how they achieved that but it's been done.
The comments about the interior being nothing special is true!  It is a hole in the wall joint that could use a makeover. But that would be the interior and not the help or the food!
We went with high expectations, and we were not disappointed.  If you are seeking a fabulous and trendy atmosphere, this is the place.  Decor is very chic, and the music playing in the background is just at the right volume.  While this is a large room, Asian screen style dividers give the illusion of many small rooms, almost a maze.  Very cool.
I haven't had any issues ever ordering from here. Ive usually been for take out and the food is always hot and fresh. The portions are quite generous. The lunch specials are reasonably priced for the mass amount of food you get. My one disappointment was the salt and pepper pork chops which weren't crispy at all, more of a bread crumb coating instead of the cornstarch coating I've grown to love.
You most likely will not agree with us on this one but that's OK and I say that because of the Yelp Rating and the crowd I saw while dining here my Yelp is being based on two lunches .
We were served expired beer, if they aren't rotating their product it makes you nervous about what else they aren't rotating back there.
Living in the Valley of the Sun, the Asian population is not concentrated while spread out throughout the valley, so getting really good authentic Chinese food is a challenge.  Long ago, I think Wong's was owned by, run by and the cooks were all Chinese.
First of all, I am always nervous about Chinese takeout. Will the price be right. Will the food taste nastier than a squid's behind?
I only rated the food.
Prices are great- about $6 each for lunch which includes soup. wonton and eggroll as well as entree.
Your dinner comes with all the soy sauce/hot mustard/sweet & sour/duck sauce that you'll need and a big ass egg-fried rice. 
Seared scallop with fresh mango in chili sauce- by far the best cooked scallops. Crispy crust and butter soft inside. I loved this dish!
This used to be my go to take out place or Chinese but it's not as good as it once was.  I think there are new owners....The all day combo plate is still a good deal for an entree, rice, and an egg roll. But, the last two times I've gotten beef and broccoli and the beef has been stringy and chewy and there have been whole cloves of raw garlic in it that are really less than appetizing to bite into.
Cleanliness- 3 out of 5
Great food! I always get the avocado salad.. It's sooo fresh! The family style tofu is great too. Hubby gets Kung pao chicken and loves it! This place is great for fresh, fast Chinese food.
Let me preface this by saying, I am Chinese, from a Chinese family, raised in the East Coast, many family style dinners in NYC with lazy susans, bad service, and sketchy locations.  I was also brought up cooking Cantonese.  So am I harsh on my ratings?  Probably.  But, some things I feel are just unacceptable.
A hidden gem for authentic Chinese food in Las Vegas casino. We were staying at Encore and this restaurant is so conveniently located. The quality of food is exceptional and no MSG was detected in the food during our two meals at this restaurant. Although it's a bit pricy but it's worth it if you wanted to have a nice and light Chinese meal/snack in Las Vegas. Great customer service too!
In general, pretty good place to have some schzhuan style food.
Now on to the blissful food. Two words: Katsu Chicken. I could eat the entire plate myself but I did share. It's breaded chicken that's so tender, you don't need a knife to cut it. The breaded chicken is bathed in a sweet Teriyaki sauce and sits upon a heap of egg fried rice. It's delightfully delicious upon every bite. So much so that I went back to seconds (and thirds). Secondly, the Sweet and Sour chicken. It's pretty much your standard Sweet & Sour chicken but it's good, tender and worth a second helping as well! Their lettuce wraps were juicy and a great starter. We didn't get dessert, but I noticed chocolate won tons and banana spring rolls which sounded pretty sensational as well! 
- great food
The cold noodle dish is prepared with hot chili oil and vinegar. There appears to be random bits of spongy soy product around. Not an issue, especially since they soak up a lot of flavor.
The owner is SUPER nice and they have two menus, which if you are Asian, you know what I mean.
For the most part, the food was ok, nothin really phenomenal, the name of the restaurant does say "Express", so expect some short cuts in the cuisine.
I only tried one thing here... the Szechuan Beef Noodle Soup. It was so flavorful and delicious. There was just the right amount of spice in the sauce that gave it a slight tang that put it over the top for me. The noodles themselves were perfect. They weren't too soft or too hard. The only thing I didn't like was having to pay $14 for beef noodle soup.
Good chinese for a chain. Always consistent. Hot and sour soup os my fav. Actually has a bit pf spice.
This place never disappoints me! It's conveniently down the street from me and I always order takeout when I'm feeling lazy, ha!
Also, one other reviewer mentioned how nice the delivery guy was...and he's very right...uber-friendly and polite.  Nice job Lucky Kitchen!
-Special Flavor Tomato Egg Noodle Soup ($6.95). The soup base reminds me of my mother's tomato and egg dish; slightly sweet with a zest of tomato flavor and sprinkling of eggs. 
I always get #34 (Beef, Noodles, w/XO sauce) or the #27 (Seafood Noodle Soup) and love both. The noodles plates are big; unless you are a big eater, expect to take some home. The mango smoothie w/boba is also delicious; you can taste the fruit and know it's fresh.
Go to Miu's. I fantasize about it. You won't regret it.
Price: 5 out of 5
Tonight it was a bit chilly out side and I wanted some type of hot soup. I decided to call Chen's and ordered their WOR WON TON NOODLE SOUP. It warmed up my inner SOUL.
Not bad.  We ordered the beef chow fun, mongolian beef, chicken lo mein, and the teriyaki chicken.  We also brought in a coupon for free cream cheese crab won tons.  I didn't care much for the mongolian beef, but there was nothing bad about it, really.  My husband loved his beef chow fun.  I think I will probably try all new items next time.  The teriyaki chicken was pretty good though and I loved the cream cheese crab won tons.  The price was right and service was good too.
Chinese food is by far my favorite cuisine and I have traveled around the world trying dishes.  I'm giving this a five star purely for the house special crispy pan fried noodles with seafood.  They are very generous with their portions with fairly large shrimp, fish, calamari, and best of all a couple pieces of jumbo scallops.  If you are a seafood lover  this is a must get.  The sauce is incredible in its flavor and compliments the crispy noodles.  My 10 yr old daughter is not a fan of seafood, but she loves the sauce  with the noodles.  I've tried several other entres in my numerous visits, and they are consistently very good especially for its location considering it not near any of the little asias in Phoenix.
We had the Chinese broccoli with beef, which was a little salty but excellent. I love the flavor on the beef and the crisp green broccoli. The lobster was wonderful, with a lot of nice ginger flavor and a thick, tasty sauce. My favorite was the salt and pepper shrimp. Lots of fresh green and white onions, with extremely spicy little peppers that gave the entire dish a great kick. The accompanying rice didn't seem fresh, but the portion was big.
Next time I will just tell them I would like it a bit spicer. Lots of parking in the lot.
They have fantastic lunch specials- super good prices and just the right sized portions.
Disgusting!!! There is too much breading on their "crispy" teriyaki chicken. And I think the chicken is on steroids because there's no way it can be this big. I can feel stomach cramps arising. Ugh
For the main course, we both decided on the mongolian beef. We were warned that it would be just a bit spicy, but we didn't care. We could handle it. It was spicier than I thought it would be but it really was one of the best chinese dinners I have ever had. It was mixed with many vegetables that were equally great. 
Definitely great lunch specials, at great prices, with nice service.
Overall, while the majority of the food was OK, I don't think (like most have said) that it is anything out of the ordinary for a rinky-dink chinese delivery place. Definitely wasn't good enough to have an hour wait time on some delivery. 
The waitstaff don't all speak the best English, but that is the case at many restaurants. While they may seem brusque, I've never had any problem getting what I want. The maitre'd IS fluent in English, as well as friendly and helpful.
I love this place!!!
The leeche martini was so over the top sweet and then the glass rimmed with sugar - I think I went into diabetic shock on this alone.
I ate here twice while in Vegas. Hubby was down for the count due to too much partying. We were looking for some rice, noodles, or soup for him. We found Dragon Noodle in our hotel and decided to check it out.
Very large menu with Live Crab, and Lobster that you can pick from the nearby tanks if you wish. They have both the typical Americanized dishes and some of the more Authentic Dishes. Nice!
Dumplings were nothing remember-able 
3. Foods are not good and expensive. 
This place was recommended by a co-worker when first moved to Phoenix. 
1. they sell boba
Sea food like crab and lobster is very reasonably priced and the flavors at this restaurant are amazing.  Some other great dishes are the seafood soup and number 24 (the chinese reads ba jun tofu).
After consulting Yelp, I know now there is a "real" Chinese menu here. That explains why this place could be so popular with native speakers. I wish I had known. This review reflects the disappointing experience I had with the menu I was presented with.
The service is such garbage, the food isn't great either. Came at 3pm on a Saturday and they were about half full. We had to request water three times before it actually came. My party ordered pho, dumplings, and some rice plates. The rice plates was filling but the pho was not. The combination pho was pretty bland to me and no hoisin sauce to make it better. We also ordered four smoothies with our food but it never came and we asked the waiter and he made it like 5 minutes before we finished our meal. The drinks were refreshing, and its pretty cheap for what it is. Overall the food is pretty unsatisfying but it's cheap so that sort of makes it okay.
Another dish, noodle based, is seasoned like their cold noodle dish, except everything is hot (temp wise), and the noodles are long and thick, with some green onion and bean sprouts. Again, spicy and sour, just the way I like it. Noodles are nice and appropriately chewy. Just the right amount of "QQ."
Banana in a Box - what's that you wonder? its a 4-walled rectangular box about half a foot high made of hardened carmel, and filled with warm bananas and carmel cream, drizzelled with more carmel n chocolate (of course).  super delish!
So we have eaten here several times and each time the food and service has been very good. We usually sit at the bar for drinks and food. I love sushi but do yourself a favor and skip it here, very disappointing. The sizzling platter surf and turf is addicting. Sliced fillet Mignon, shrimp, veggies, I crave it! The mister got the Jeweled Beef on the last visit. Fillet Mignon, Asian noodles and veggies wok fried in a chili sauce. Our server warned him on the heat level but he ordered it anyway. If you like spicy food this one if for you. I had one bite and it was way too hot for me but I am a bit of a wimp when it comes to spicy foods....damn you acid reflux!
I had Mongolian Beef, flavorful and very tender but cut a bit thicker than I prefer. My BF had a soft tofu dish that was smokey and spicey and our friend had the sizzling chicken and sausage clay pot. I normally detest sausage but this was so delicious; flavorful, smokey and noticeably absent were the "mystery chunks" that normally make me gag when I eat sausage. We all split curry shrimp fried rice which was yummy if a bit spicy.  It had finely chopped water chestnuts which I usually hate but they gave the rice an interesting crispy but not crunchy texture.
Food was horrible!   I had the Teriyaki Chicken Bowl & it literally was rice, chicken, & sauce.  Who has a chicken bowl with no vegetables.   The chicken & sauce were completely bland.  Will never be back
Ok, so what's worth eating here. Get the buns, it's filling. And if you miss dim sum, they have decent pork shu mai and prawn dumplings (ha gau). *Shrugs*
Seriously, for those of you looking for a truly authentic Chinese meal -- I implore you to try this restaurant -- now mind you, this was a simple Tuesday night -- and it was slammed.   This is a completely hidden, local Chinese only secret, which probably explains the reason there is only one mediocre review... and btw, the fish aren't in a tank by the door... 
If you are a fan of good Chinese food, you should try this place too and NOT judge this place based on bad delivery reviews.
did i really get the FTR here? it's been open forever! this really is a consistently good panda, as far as panda express goes. stay away from anything chicken that isn't made with breast meat. i like the string bean chicken and the beijing beef. g likes the beef with broccoli, but sometimes they're a little chintzy on the beef. the "crab" puffs definitely aren't made with crab, but they're delicious little cream cheese filled, calorie laden, fried balls of goodness. service is friendly all the time and the price is right for a quick grab and go lunch. for my low carb diet, a panda bowl with steamed veggies instead of rice or chow mein and string bean chicken is filling and tasty. you're not getting the highest quality food, but you know you're getting something decent. 3 stars.
I would like to make my rating based on three things: Food quality, customer service and consistency. I've tried MANY asian food establishments here in the valley since moving here three years ago and this is by far the best I've had! I usually order To Go and my food is always ready before I get there and am greeted with a kind hello and an appreciative smile (how nice!). I've ordered from them many times and have been impressed everytime. Thank you for the great food!!
The service was great - the waitress was nice and patient when we took a while to order - even suggested dishes to us. The dishes weren't expensive - average and reasonable prices for pretty good portions.
OMG very delicious shrimp with walnuts!  Wait to order after 5p, spend $15 and get free crab puffs! Sooo awsome. Service is always speedy, friendly and accurate. You won't be disappointed. My love feels he's had the best orange chicken ever.
Me and a friend started out with the Bo bo platter. The Spring rolls were average, the BBQ beef had almost no flavor, and the other things were mediocre.
Family owned and operated hands down best orange chicken and house friend rice in town do yourself a serious favor and stop eating all those wanna be chinese food fast food places this place is just as quick just as cheap but twice as good trust me I'm Hawaiian and ya lol I grew up eating a lot of asain food this place knows what up
Brought my book club here for an evening of discussion and great Chinese food. In addition, the website boasted 1.99 glasses of house wine. We checked with server and asked about the wine specials and were advised, no, they were 2.99. Still a great deal, wine for all!
We also had a soup before our meal (not sure what it was, but it was good) and a warm dessert soup with sweet potatoes after our meal (great flavor, not a big fan of sweet potatoes though). The whole meal was enjoyable! Wendy was so hospitable and really personable with her customers! It was truly a pleasure to meet her, since you could tell how passionate she is about the restaurant and the food. I'm excited to try more items from the vast menu.
Decent food, but bad service. Our waitress must have had an egg roll up her butt or something that was distracting her. In all my years of dining I don't think I've ever had a server come to the table, ask only one of the two people sitting there what they wanted to drink, then walk away. Seriously - she got my friend's drink order and walked away! WTF? But then, get this, she did it again, when she came back with my friend's drink and asked if we were ready to order, I ordered my drink, and then she turned to my friend, got her order, and then turned to walk away. I stopped her this time, of course. Oh, and then later, she took my glass to get me a refill, and when she didn't come back for ten minutes, I started looking around for her, and there she was, wandering around the restaurant with it, no idea which table it was from.. The food was decent, like I said, nothing special, but edible, but with that kind of service, I ain't going back.
We told him to take the rice back then and refund us some money and he would not give a dime back.
This is the place the Arizona Republic gives top awards??? I think it's time for another visit Howie.
My hubby and I have come here for dinner multiple times in the evenings but this was the first time for lunch.
This review is for the dim sum buffet.  Absolutely my favorite buffet in Las Vegas.  We stayed at the Bellagio after Christmas and it was very busy at all the restaurants.  So we wandered into Jasmine.  This is quite a step up from your ordinary buffet.  The room is beautiful with drapes, chandeliers,  tablecloths, china and silverware.  Best of all is a beautiful view of the fountains.  There are several stations with a chef serving you including the carving station, seafood, salads, soups, and crepes as well as a variety of dim sum and desserts. We had fun eating the fresh lychee fruit.  It was a relaxed and comfortable setting, no crowds.  Service was excellent.  My only complaint is that beverages are not included.  I think for the price at least they could offer some juice, soda or hot tea.  The good news is they offer a reduced price for children although I would recommend it for older children who enjoy Asian food.  I would definitely return.
For our delivery they said 35 minutes, which turned into 103 minutes before we got our food. The owner was apologetic, and recooked and delivered our order.   He said they have a new delivery person who got lost.  
Not impressed at all! Rice is under cooked, crab puffs were inconsistent; either huge and super cheesy, or a tiny folded crisp. Shrimp tasted weird. The delivery guy kind of spilled the sauce so the bottom of the bag was drenched. Delivery speed was mediocre. Don't think I'll order from here again unless I'm desperate.
This little diamond has been hiding behind the Fashion Show Mall and tucked away behind a bar for goodness knows how long! In all my years in Vegas this delicious place has been concealed from my palate! How dare everyone! Now that I have been clued in to this jewel of a place it has easily become my favorite chinese food place! Going to China Town on Spring Mountain is nice. The neighborhood looks nice, the shops are nice. The prices are ok. Sometimes the service and attitude is lacking from staff and servers. I rarely see smiles or any conversation there. It is very dry. 
My only complaint would be that their tofu dishes had meat in them so there weren't as many vegetarian options as I would have like to have seen.  I didn't get a chance to ask if they can adjust them for vegetarians, but will the next time I go and before I take any of my veggie buddies there.
The service is fast. The food is delicious and the owner is extremely sweet. We've been coming there for years so on occasion, he'll bring us an extra dish to sample like the amazing Walnut Shrimp.
Our new hot spot for cheap, good Chinese lunch specials.
This place is the best!!! They make the noodles fresh to order and even have a little viewing window so you can watch them make it. The prices are reasonable and the staff is super friendly. I love coming here.
Beef Chow Mein 
Ordered the pot stickers, which were delicious.
Went here on a Sun. night.  Got a table with no problem.  If you are looking for authentic Chinese, this is probably not the best place.  It's sort of like upscale PF Chang's.  Although I must say, the food was pretty tasty.  The seafood was really high quality.  Being at a nice casino on the strip, I expect to pay premium prices.  However, for this price-point the service was disappointing.  They seated us in the corner of an empty restaurant and completely forgot about us.  It took 3 requests and 20 mins to get our check.      Chinese restaurants are notorious for bad service and this is just another example.
It's not only Chinese - they have Thai and Vietnamese items... which I refused to try. I'm not a fan of Chinese food outside of Chinatown and SGV. We only came here because fast and easy.
I got the combination (chicken, beef and shrimp) friend rice as an entree and three Chinese spring rolls as an appetizer. The spring rolls were freshly prepared and were delicious! What really got me was my entree! It was cooked to perfection in my opinion. With a few dash of soy sauce and some chili sauce, my entree was completed! 
Szechwan Beef noodle soup: dark clear broth, had a spicy note to it but did not linger. Beef were cut into good sized cubes, meat soaked in the wonderful broth flavors and were filling. Thick noodles went perfect with the meat. 
I seriously wish I checked Yelp before coming here to see how bad this place was. Granted, I didn't order any of the noodles (which this place is named after), I thought I would try some of the meat dishes.
So, if you are into getting ripped off and eating crappy food, I recommend Pong Pong!  :)
The lady brought out the food and she was confused about what she brought out. She told us one of the plates were a vegetarian dumpling plate so my friend tried it only to spit it out because there was meat!! How rude! How do you not know what you're bringing out!
Not so much.  The first couple times I ate there it was good not great definitely NOT New York.  The last time I ate there it was horrible and I haven't been back.  I'm still in search of really good chinese food in Phoenx.  Alas I think its a fairy tale.
This place is a treasure in the east valley. In an area of town where the competition is stiff, this place blows it away. Great noodles. The juices are good and nice unique sauces. Prices are surprisingly low. I will soon be a regular.
Seriously amazing cuisine, service and atmosphere. Our server Lilly was so kind and definitely helped us figure out which drinks, appetizers and main dishes to order. Everything was absolutely delicious. My favorite dishes were the Crispy Duck salad, a great combination of unique flavors, on the sweet side but still refreshing. My favorite dish was the Black truffle Roasted duck. the rest of my party loved both these dishes and the res of what we ordered was great too. The dumplings were unique and a definite as well. The braised lobster with spinach noodles was delicious and a quite a different dish that it was very enjoyable to try. Just hate messing with the shells from the lobster. 
Definitely recommended to all "locals" from Hawaii that long for the ono style cooking of home.
The lady came by 4 times:
At first glance you see the English menu and you see the Chinese menu.. tell them to keep the English menu and translate the Chinese menu. The English menu is the typical stuff you'd find at any American Chinese food place.. now the Chinese menu is where all the good stuff is. Fortunately Helen speaks and read Chinese so it was a snap. Ive been super excited about trying Shanghainese cooking and this place was no disappointment.
Pasty a-holes.
The Low Down:
for $14.89 (Used $20 dining credit for the coupon book and a $10 voucher for staying the night)
The frog legs are pretty good! :)
This is a place that has decent quality food. It's in a very small blink and you'll miss it place and has it own set of regulars that come. it's very small and quiet inside and there's almost no one at the counter until they hear someone come in. We come here every now and then. I love their egg rolls. I'd recommend their lunch specials. They are listed on the window and you get rice with your order as well as an eggroll in a medium size container for less than $5. Only until 3:30 PM each day. I love getting the beef and broccoli lunch special. It's much cheaper then getting the beef and broccoli  with rice later for around $8 with no egg roll :( Haha
Decent, fast Chinese food.  Can't really go wrong with a dinner that costs less than $10 and leaves you with enough food for another full meal the next evening.  The Kung Pao Chicken was pretty good, a little heavy on the sauce perhaps and the egg drop soup was basically broth only, with some egg thrown in, guess I didn't really know what I expected. 
The dessert bar is the highlight here: cookies, pastries, chocolates and a dip-it-yourself chocolate fondue station. Heaven.
Service is slow and inconsistent though -- so less a star. But I stand firm that, if you like Chinese food and you are hungry, then this is the place to go.
I love this restaurant. It's a favorite locale for my husband's family and I love going to dinner with them here. It's always a very positive experience. My favorite part is the lazy susan centerpiece. We all order our own plate and have it placed in the center. Everyone shares and we all get a bit of everything. It makes for a very diverse meal. 
I never giving one star review but honestly I feel like it was the worst chinese food might have ever had in my life. Worst part was I really wanted too give this place a chance since so close too my house like five mins. So with open mind knowing that most of the reviews negative ones. I see for myself. Not worth it. The only thing positive the lady was very nice asking her questions and helping me figure out what should try since it was my first time. Her noodle recommendation telling me most popular baffles me. It had no flavor and mean NO flavor or distinct flavor of anything! I understand certain noodles get gravy type of sauce depending on the noodle. It was so dry that felt like needed water too get it down. Other thing order (sorry all take out) general tao chicken. She was telling me spicy but nothing spicy about it. Again NO flavor just tasted so bland need too put shoyu or something on top give it something. Both of it was BAD Chinese food.
The menu is extensive and has standard Chinese fare plus many authentic dishes. The sesame chicken is great. I always order the honey shrimp. Be forewarned though, that Cafe Noodle's honey shrimp might have more of the sweet mayo than usual. But the shrimps are large, which I like. Also, their duck is fantastic, as well as their fried bass. Also, try their pan fried seafood chow mein. I love my noodles extra crispy, and they make it just right. It is amazing. 
The food was good, a bit too much oil for my taste, but not greasy in the slightest.  We ordered chicken lo mein for the kiddos, and unfortunatley for them it was chock-a-block full of veggies and chicken. My kids haven't discouvered the joys of stir fried veggies as yet - we're working on it.  We also ordered chicken with broccoli with a white sauce, which was an enormous portion and again, everyone enjoyed.   Rounding out the feast was a roasted pork and chinese eggplant dish which was sweet and hot as well as a stir fried green bean plate.  We probably could have gotten away with ordering three dishes or a small size instead of all large.
Everything I've ever ordered (I get take out about once a week and try to mix it up with safe faves and new diversions), has been fantastic.  Diamonds is the real deal for Chinese in Phoenix, as substantiated by the fact that every time I'm in there there's  a very healthy multi-cultural   mix of Asians, Latinos and Euros.  When you walk in and you see the bubbling tanks of fresh fish & crustaceans plus a room full of Chinese diners -- you know the place is good. 
One of the main suggestions for this restaurant is: DO NOT ORDER THE ORANGE CHICKEN.  (hint: it's not really chinese food) Instead, ask one of the servers what the chef's special is for the day.  Or, try out one of my fave dishes.  You won't be disappointed!
Personally this place is like the happy medium between a Panda Express and Pei-Wei (And what is so great about pei-wei anyway? Someone please tell me!)
Edit 1/15/2014:  Since my original posting in April 2012, I have ordered here a bunch of times with good consistent quality each time but this most recent experience left a bad taste in my mouth and I won't be ordering here anymore.  I ordered my usual Mongolian beef dinner, order of Pork Fried Rice, and crab puffs and the lady who took my order can recite it from memory every time which is amazing.  So I trusted her to do the same in this instance and thought my order would arrive all good.   
It is a typical chinese restaurant but I think the food is better than most chinese knock-off restaurants. I think that if you can enjoy the authentic atmosphere and the food (pink menu if you are scared of authentic chinese), then you should be satisfied with your meal. Personally, I get mine to go 99% of the time because I will take it home and not feel bad when I load my plate up with everything and go back for seconds!!
So I went and decided to let her lead.  They bring out the hot jasmine tea to poor into these little cups.  I must say that on a cold (well Arizona cold) day this was fantastic.  It was full of flavor and a nice start to the meal.  We both ordered the sesame chicken lunch combo and boy was I in for a treat.  
Ah well, still won't stop me from coming back. It's a wonderful late night craving.
Man if i could give it 6 stars i would this place is amazing and cheap were talking appetizer 3 alacart   Items white rice and desert for $31.00 we eat there and brought back half of it so you know its a deal when that happens   Service was out of this world felt like i was a family member.
We searched the streets close to 9-ish looking for somewhere to eat after we spent some time relaxing in the Apex. Finally, something was open. In bright letters, "Saigon, Saigon". We looked at eachother - to hell with it. It was a tiring day and we just wanted to eat something.
Service:  3.5 stars.  I'm kind of conflicted trying to score this.  The staff was very nice, the hostess and waiter were extremely polite and both were attentive and very helpful, but nothing seemed extraordinary.  Nothing really seemed to stand out as either good or bad.  They did their job and they did it well, but other than that, there was little interaction.  The best part about the service was the story our waiter told us at the end of our meal.  I really appreciated the interaction he finally gave us but it was after we had already paid.
The broccoli beef and ginger mushroom chicken were okay. The chow mien was the worst I've ever had. Undercooked and bland. I'm a good eater and left it all on the plate.
Went here for the first time and was pretty disappointed after reading such great reviews. The egg drop soup was so thick I couldn't eat it. Very gelatin looking. I had the orange chicken as directed by reviews and it was OK. Not wonderful but not bad. Left much of my Chinese craving unsatisfied.
If there is something not up to par just ask and they will fix it, (although I have NEVER had to.
Return Factor - 87%
Most recently I had a nice female server who returned often and was very sweet. 
The goldfish tanks are neat. Just don't eat.
My partner and I went to Noodle Asia the day we arrived in Las Vegas.  We checked into the Venetian around lunchtime, so by the time we were settled in our room we were quite hungry.  I had looked at the dining book in the room and I saw that Noodle Asia had vegetarian dishes, so we decided to go there.
They have a sauce "bar".  Basically a wooden book shelf with metal containers of the essential sauces.  I mix almost everything together....peanut sauce, garlic, sa cha, green onions....and whatever tastes good.  I usually add an egg to my sauce but I didn't see any at the sauce "bar".
For right bucks it was huge on portions. One person can't finish one combo. The orange chicken was on par with what you'd expect. The rice and noodles were way good. 
If you deducted stars on those reasons you must have flown to China.
I'd come back just for the lunch specials and look forward to trying other items :)
The dumplings were equally as delicious.  They were fried to a nice consistency on each side and the accompanying sauce could be drank on its own.
Grandma got BBQ Pork Rice plate- very good actually. Pork was juicy and nicely spiced. We all want to order the BBQ Pork here again.  Rice plates usually come with some steamed veggie as well. 
Assorted Meat & Shrimp w/ Clear Noodles ($6.50): Delicious! The broth was light yet flavorful, and there were a lot of things to eat other than noodles in my soup. I especially enjoyed the greens, the pork, the shrimp & the squid, along with the fish cake slices & the itty bitty pieces of fried, crackling pig skin which gave texture to the soup. The fish balls were not my favorite, however. One thing I thought could've been better was the noodles themselves- they were a tad overcooked, making for too soft noodles that I couldn't really enjoy. If the noodles had been chewier, I think this soup would've been perfect. 
The combination of substandard food and high price warrant the one star rating. I should have checked Yelp before trying this place. The low rating would have kept us away.
But I wouldn't recommend this place.
We tried the orange chicken (good but not at all what we're used to) the veggie chow Mein, Mongolian beef and S&S chicken; all of which were similar to what we know in Seattle and all very good.
The service was quite good, we would eat there again.
- located downstairs from Airia Nightclub 
This restaurant just opened up less than a month ago, and I'm the first to be a reviewer! 
We opted for a good mix - one order of veggie dumplings, a pork dish, chicken satay, crispy beef, and shrimp and veg tempura.  
all in all a very good experiance and i will be ordering more from them. probably often.
Oh and their taro coconut tapioca drink is yummy. It reminds me of a taro dessert my mom would make. It's creamy, coconut milk with taro chunks, sweetened and with little clear tapioca pearls. 
To the lady upset about a tip being added:  Um deal with it?  I'd hate to see how you fare in a country where this is the norm (try most of Europe).  Rate the food and the service, not a small idiosyncrasy that, by your own admission, saved you money in the end.
At the end of the meal we got free dessert. I believe it was supposed to be almond jello but there were no jello pieces. It was like dessert soup hehe. It was all liquid.
I can't wait to come back!
most likely you don't.  And it will be long time before you can save up that money and really enjoy the fine cuisine and culture of the illustrious country of China.  
2. Entrees came out way before the appetizer. 
The Peking duck here is delicious. Very interesting that they bring out the duck to carve part of it for the first dish then bring back the remaining duck in the kitchen to make the second dish which was a lettuce wrap. My wife and I ended up sharing this dish and we barely ate half of the duck, so I would recommend sharing this dish with someone. 
Also as a caveat, there isn't any real Shanghai speciality food here even though the restaurant is named Shangahi Lilly. 0_o
Growing up in the Upper Midwest we had two basic types of food - normal food and Chinese food. Normal food was anything your mother could cook at home, which included Italian, Mexican and the cultural staples of a largely Scandinavian and German population.
ribs, are okay, not amazing but solid.
We took our food home and were very happy with our choices. Egg rolls were large and delicious. The price was only one dollar. Delightful! We had cashew shrimp. The shrimp were large and there was a delicious variety of vegetables . The chicken with mushrooms was outstanding. The portion was large and the sauce was superb. Best Chinese we have had in Madison.
The main courses are solid, and we can't budge our kids from their favorites. My son, 19 and 6'7" has two favorites, the Cinnamon Shrimp and the Sweet and Sour Chicken. The shrimp are plump and sautéed with peas and carrots in a sweet-spicy sauce with a hint of cinnamon. It is served, as several of Flo's dishes are, over shredded lettuce. Yeah, shredded lettuce. My favorite dish, the Lemon Pepper Shrimp and Chicken, comes over shredded lettuce and it hits all the gustatory pleasure zones. The shrimp pops in your mouth, the chicken is sliced thin and together with the lemon and pepper, the oils and scallions, is savory and spicy, crunchy and rich. I have to tell you, I've tried to speak while eating it and drooled right in front of a loan officer I'd taken to lunch. It's just the price of doing business at Flo's. 
Amazing Home made style! Love it!
Good place
Very good, quick, kind service! The $9 combo is pretty typical for all of the food you get. The Mongolian beef was a tad salty but still above average. I'd definitely go here again!
Good service, could be better but no real complaints. 
Today got the orange chicken lunch special ($5.25). Orange chicken, fried rice, cream cheese puff and egg roll. The orange chicken was a bit spicy for my taste, but good. I don't think I'll get the fried rice again, not much a fan of that. Also got an order of pot stickers ($4.95) that were tasty! Love love love the cream cheese puffs! 
Best Value and Some of Best Noodles in Vegas
Basically, this is Chinese food for the non-adventurous. Very familiar flavors without the "what the hell am I eating" component that you get with most authentic Chinese places. You're going to get very safe food that caters to the cautious eater.
They dropped off the check and you pay it at the front counter. But 3 people were up there and they were all yelling in Chinese at each other about something.
3 Stars ain't a bad thing. I went in on a Saturday afternoon and was the only one there. I watched as egg rolls were made by hand and I was able to place a quite sizeable order and asked all sorts of questions. They don't use microwaves, everything's cooked to order, business isn't as busy as it was during the boom times, etc. I enjoyed the conversation and walked out with $60+ worth of food and even got help taking it to my car. 
Choice of 3 soups (Won Ton, Hot&Sour and Egg Drop) got the Won Ton - the dumpling was pretty meaty and wrap texture was al dente, chewy bite to it. (I like it cooked more and softer)  The broth was full of flavor, steamy hot, sprinkled with bits of chopped green onions and slivers of char siu pork, for me it was pretty basic and just a tad salty though  Mr B. says I have hypersensitive taste buds and he thought this was the best Won Ton soup by far. 
To be honest, I haven't had Hong Kong style café food in a long time. Granted I've been in a HK Café deprived area (UCI campus), the food here is pretty kick ass. The restaurant is in kind of a marketplace and has plenty of parking when I went. It kind of smelled like Boiling Crab, but then Cravin' Cajun is right across the street. As we walked in, I noticed that the whole restaurant was really nice, from décor, to cleanliness, to ambiance and we were welcomed quickly and shown to our table.
I generally stick with the orange chicken here because it is quite good.  Unlike other versions of orange chicken, the taste of the orange in the sauce is distinct and there are even chuncks of oranges on your plate.
- chow fun is better than Seafood Cove. Not too oily and gave fair share of beef. 
1--Spicy Beef and Scallion Dumplings--a little too salty for me. It was ok, but nothing amazing. 
The soup arrived promptly.  Nothing better then hearing that spppplash of rice in the hot soup.  This soup needed no additional seasonings (with the exception of pepper, which I add to everything).  It was perfectly salted, perfectly heated, and filled with hearty vegetables and meats.  I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the shrimp in the soup.  It did not have any fishy taste to it what so ever.
Ordered delivery from them for the first time. Surprise! the entrees come not in those little cardboard containers most Chinese restaurants use, but in medium- sized clamshells. Wow! What huge portions! I ordered the brocolli beef, crystal shrimp, chicken fried rice, and a large wor wonton soup and 2 liters of soda and my total came to under $34, The food was quite good; the brocolli was cooked to perfection, the beef tender and flavorful, and the chicken was shredded in big hunks versus being cubed like most places. The shrimp was tender and quite good. The wor wonton soup was OK, but the snow peas were disappointingly mushy-- probably a casualty of the hot soup.
anyhow...the decor and atmosphere was awesome.  i wish people would dress appropriately though.  it is a fine dining restaurant.  
SOLID!!!
GO NOW. 
To me... if a customer gives you a bill to break for your bill even though it's not much of a change, you should always give back the change and let the customer decide what to do with the rest of the money... well, the guy hands me my food and said thank you....  I was going to give him the tip anyway but I didn't understand why he didn't place it in the tray and let me make that decision.... why does he have to make that decision for me?  Yes... I'm Asian, but I definitely would never do that because the change is still "not my money until given"  So that irked me quite a bit even if it's a little bit of chump change...
This place was recommended to me as some of the best Chinese food in Madison.  Totally agree!
The Beef Szechwan noodles were good but at $13.95 a pop? I know, it's the Venetian, it's Vegas, blah blah. Forgiven.  It's just that I'm used to getting it for $4.50 at home, so the price threw me off a bit. 
And I have experienced in the past, in different Chinese or Japanese restaurants (the big one being Wagamama) when they bring your food out at different times as and when it's ready - for freshness. Fair dos. But not so fair when the waiting time between one main course and another is 30 minutes. By which point the big boiled rice and veggie sides had gone cold. 10 minutes max between main courses is acceptable if the food is really worth it and super fresh.
Yesterday I tried the hainan steamed chicken for the first time and it's pretty yummy, I wish they would use more ginger and spices but my bf loved it!
Crunchy Spicy Tuna Roll.
The total cost? Twenty-six dollars. Ridiculous. To make things better, everything was delicious, and the server was very friendly and helpful. My only regret is I didn't order off of the Tokyo Style part of the menu, but there will be another opportunity for that. With such cheap prices and great service, this place is true hidden gem.
If you are looking for reheated frozen food in a terrible atmosphere then head on down to the Red Mansion. I guess most Chinese restaurants use froZen stuff, but if I'm going to eat junk I'll spend about $50 less and eat it at Panda Express. Do I really need to pay $50 more for the privilege to eat under spot lights on full blast in a restaurant where the manager and employees talk about you and laugh after you ask them to
REALLY GOOD FOOD!
The only thing you can't get at lunch time is their after-dinner, Banana Caramel Delights! They drop one off for each person with the check.This isn't the actual name for them, but as they are complimentary and not on the menu, I'm not sure what they are called. They are basically banana filled crispy wonton wrappers that are then coated in a crunchy, sugary, caramel coating. If you like bananas and sweet things, you'll love these! 
I love pf changs. I just moved to the Vegas area and decided to order togo after work. Granted it was busy, but the service I got was horrible. When I called to place the order, after collecting my order, name and number, I asked how long it was going to take, I got hung up on. Ok, no biggie, called back to ask, was left on hold for 7 minutes. I decided to drive down there And do a curbside pickup. 35 minutes later I was still waiting in my car. I called from my car again, I was told they were going to inform someone I was waiting. Still nothing. I went in, and waited for another 20 minutes, i was told they were going to check on my order, no follow up, nothing. I left after an hour.. Waste of my precious time. Didn't get to try the food, the service sucked.
The owner originates from the hong kong/guangdong area, speaking Cantonese. I know we are in good hands here. Since this is a Cantonese-based restaurant, the dishes I tried are from the Canton region. Hence once again, similar to my reviews of other Chinese places, it doesn't apply to American-Chinese food, since these are not what I usually get. 
Our waitress was nice, if a little off. She thanked us sheepishly every time we said that our food did, in fact, taste good. Kind of funny the first time. Weirder and weirder every time after.
I am not a Chinese food fan so I will  keep this brief and leave the reviewing to the more qualified Yelpers.
They do have hot chili oil on the tables readily available.  And they do have rock sugar available for chrysanthemum tea.
She just waived that dish as free and refused to give any other dish or drink to compensate -- well whos gonna pay for a dish with BUG.
I tried this place out two years ago when they served the same kind of food other Grand China restaurant. The food was okay, nothing good or special, just like Panda Express. Anyway, a few months ago, I saw an ad in asian newspaper that they expanded their menu and included alot more vietnamese items. We have been visiting a few times and tried different items. Pho is definitely not good, but not horrible bad like Pho Hoang down the road. Noodle soups are the best (vegas standard), the broth is very flavorful. Their combination fried rice is pretty good too. For those who live in SouthWest, this place would save you some driving to Chinatown. Basically, if you think Panda Express is an awesome place, you may not like their new menu. But if you are so used to authentic chinese or vietnamese food, I would definitely recommend it. By the way, when we visited this place the first time, the place was empty, which normally is not a good sign. But after a few visits, I realized that their location (dark surrounding at night) and lack of advertisement are the cause of their slow business. The waitress that works there is very nice.
Okay - I am not a foodie, just looking for some decent Chinese food.  Read the yelp review on House of Yang, and decided to try it.  
Speed: It's called China a Go Go, and I barely have time to do my social media checkins or post a comment on Yelp before my food is bagged up and brought to the table. 
Just moved over to the area  and our other local Chinese food place no longer are able to deliver to us...so went on yelp and saw a few reviews....called and spoke to a very nice man named Leo. He took our order and I asked him if they had any coupons if you spend a certain $$ amount do you guys give any extra(s) such as an extra spring roll(s) or crab ran goons, which are my favorite hehe, he said that it didn't apply to the family dinner option we ordered.... But when we received our order he had added a couple extra In there. Nice touch, for our first time.. Don't expect it every time of coarse but could see he wanted to earn our business .. Def will call them for our next time...... ;) wanted to try a couple other places in the area too...but will be back here food was good and hot and yummy ;)
Lunch specials are 5.95 and 6.95, they use only white meat. Great service.
Recommended entre: Any of the chicken entres are my choice.
It's hit or miss here on their other dishes... sometimes they are really good and sometimes they are just 'eh'.  I'm not a fan of their noodle dishes.  They seem to heavy and starchy. (Note: their rice isn't anything all that great either.... it tends to be dry.)
   First we had the egg flower ( egg drop) soup which had Campbell soup like chicken in it, and it was not hot. Then I ordered Mongolian beef ( I normally order orange chicken but that didn't look good), the flavor was good but the meat had a weird texture, the fried rice just looked and tasted like white rice with soy sauce. Basically the only 2 things I like was the egg roll and fortune cookie, oh and my tea lol 
2) Dan Dan Noodles with Beef
Whats is UP with their wontons? Wow. Way un-wonderfully stale and... wait... where's the meat? The only way I could eat these wontons was to soak them in the veggie soup, which was rather bland as well.
Restaurant staff were friendly and smiling. Building was clean and decor modern.   Background music was some kind of Asian rom-pop, which was a bit of a distraction.  All-in-all, not a bad experience for our annual "A Christmas Story" Chinese restaurant semi-reenactment.
We skipped out on dinner to hit up XS so by the time we came here to eat late night we were starved. We got seated right away and the food came FAST!  We were all trying to figure out if it was just we were so hungry or the food was really good. Now that I think about it, the food was probably just soso but decent for late night.
4. tune your radio to rap music 
Fast service and amazing food! had an order delivered to my home and I think its the best Chinese food I've had!
Under the noodles with sauce, thats one of the selections where you can get hand pulled noodles.
 The deep fried too oily even sitting on the minced cabbage.  But mainly. Two little bay shrimp in ea.  disappointing.  Table next to me commented to me on the peking duck.  No crisp skin.   And served with dumplins not crepes
I recently tried take out here after a very hectic work day. We walked in about 15 minutes before close and were very surprised to see two people in front of us and another who popped in after us at almost 10pm on a week night. 
Here is a brief price list:
Find another establishment until they put clients first
Ok, this really isn't the best restaurant BUT I went to Shibuya in the same trip (much more high end and higher pricing) and THIS restaurant kicked Shibuya's butt. For that, it gets another star.  I must say, considering 4 of us rolled in drunk off our @sses at 10pm the service was great! We ordered 4 sushi rolls and a bottle of sake.  The sake was good, and so was the sushi. I wish I could remember more specifics, but....that's Vegas, baby! All I know is that I will return to give it another go and hopefully write a better review...but for now, thanks for the memories Rice!
We arrived on the run. Literally trying to get fed and go catch the Niners game at 1:25. The line was about a 45 minutes deep and we just didn't have the patience for all that. I tapped the hostess on the shoulder, just as the people in the front of the line turned to look at their Iphones and asked her if we could sit at the empty counter. She must have witnessed the fire in my eyes cause we were seated moments later. 
Loved this place with the old owners, love this place with the new owners.  Is it the best Chinese food I've ever had? Heck no.  Is it a huge plate of comfort food in a nice atmosphere for cheap? Heck YES!  Reliable, consistent delivery as well.  Grab a family meal, eat for a few days.  It's like every Chinese restaurant in Vegas (outside of Spring Mtn Rd) follows the same formula with the same menu, same coupons, and same 2 family dinner specials, but this place just does it better.  If I want the type of dinner experience that I'm used to from growing up in the Bay Area, I go to Spring Mtn -- If I want a typical Vegas local take out place, I go here (or Chopstix for close to my work).
Teriyaki chicken
This was my very first dim sum experience ever, and it got me hooked. 
I really enjoyed the food here.  The staff was nice and helpful.  The portions were large and the prices were great.  Each item was around $8 and I the portion was large enough to fill one of those large styrofoam take-out boxes.  
The third in an ongoing series of restaurants I've actually never set foot in.
Expect to pay more than you should, and if you have any allergies at all, I just wouldn't trust these folks with your well-being.  Hope that helps.
The chicken curry was okay. Not really what I'm use to since I love indian and thai curry so much. If you're thinking of those kinds of curry when you order this dish, please remind yourself... it is NOWHERE near that. 
Food was ok but lacked any sort of flare or appeal, almost wonder if this would be a better lunch destination.  It's official Surprise is culturally bankrupt when it comes to Chinese/Asian food.  I might try it again, but don't hold your breath.
Service ... Needs to improve but the food is surprisingly good. Shanghai noodles is excellent. I am sure the service upfront will get better. I think main issue is language. The food is good. I was not expecting much totally surprised. Give it a try.
I ordered the pepper steak no tomatoes and my boyfriend got pork egg foo young. Wow is all I can say. The beef actually tasted like real fresh meat! Not the rubber fake kind you get at other cheap takeouts. The only draw back i had was that the peppers and onions were cut pretty big but that wasn't a huge issue. My boyfriends egg foo young was like none other and they sure didn't hold back on the sauce! The pork inside was actually Chinese bbq pork and it sure added a kick.
Prime was not.
The chicken teriyaki was nice and lean! There was a good amount of chicken in the chicken curry and chicken with mushrooms (meaning it wasn't all veggies).
All in all, the food was decent, but nothing that blew our minds. It's really convenient though if you're staying in the hotel and craving Chinese.
The fried wontons, like the soup, had almost no filling. My daughter said it looked like a tiny booger. She was right.
I ordered the chicken szechuan noodles and my hubby ordered the mongolian beef noodles.  The food arrived but my order was wrong - and, amazingly, the waitress apologized for getting my order wrong and went back to put the correct order in.  I can't recall another occasion where a wait person admitted their error - and I was impressed with her honesty.  I knew I hadn't ordered a different dish, but it was nice that she didn't try to convince me that I somehow had mistakenly said the word zucchini instead of chicken.. nor did she blame it on the cooks.
It's great, cheap, and delicious--what more do you want from a Chinese restaurant?
They deliver as well!  Be sure to ask for the free soda is you order delivery!
The menu here is hit or miss, but when it hits, it definitely hits.
The dishes here follow a very classic Cantonese menu route, so all your old, comforting favourites are here, from lemon chicken, to the everlastingly good Chow Mein, and a good old helping of crispy Peking duck and pancakes. I always eat too much when I come here, and somehow, after eating the equivalent of about six main courses, I still manage to consume a wholeheartedly calorific banana fritter at the end of it all. Tremendous.
Ate here recently based on yelp reviews. I was excited that there was a hong kong style cafe in vegas. Unfortunately, the food was mediocre at best. Had the chicken wings, portuguese pork chop over rice, and the spicy seafood noodle soup. All were passable but none would make me want you come back.
This is my go to Chinese food at least every 2 weeks. Food is always fast and consistent. I think the prices are reasonable. Very friendly family owned business.  I always ask for slat & pepper pork (not on the menu but they will make it for you...yummy) and the house wanton soup is excellent.
Physically, the place is bland. It's not home-y, but it does remind me of hole-in-the-wall faster food places abroad.
If your looking for get Chinese food this is the place prices are great and portions are big enough for leftovers and food is hot and tasty Give it a try you'll be glad you did.
Good food great prices!
I live super close to this chinese joint and because I was super hungry, decided on the pad see ewe.  I called in the order and got there w/in 2 mins.  The lady that helped me was nice.  My food was ready within 10 mins.  When I got home, I was surprise that there was a small bag of fried wontons and a small container of sweet and sour sauce.  Didn't know it came w/it like a typical fortune cookie would be.  
The place was very clean and the staff very friendly. 
They have been my only personal source for quality Chinese cuisine for over 15 years. This place is like my Chinese version of Cheers. :)
Every once in awhile I'm disappointed in my fellow yelpers.  This is one of those cases.  How can you give this place fewer than 3 stars?
Consistently delicious Chinese food.  Reasonably priced for the quality of food you get.  
Cha-ching! I got lucky my first time at Szechwan Palace! I had Helen Y. with me (Jason W. was along for the culinary experience as well), and she helped us navigate the Chinese menu, explaining about Szechwan cuisine and selecting some different dishes for us to try. I don't remember everything we tried, but the two standout dishes were definitely the fish filets and the water-boiled beef. The fish was cooked perfectly, with a creamy texture and a simple, sweet flavor. The water-boiled beef was spicy and so satisfying - my sinuses totally felt clearer as I ate it! I also enjoyed the soup buns. I'm not a big lamb fan, but the lamb riblets that Helen described in her review were good and would probably be a big hit with anyone who doesn't mind the gamier taste. 
WHY IS IT SO HARD TO FIND GOOD CHINESE FOOD IN PHOENIX!?
Came here for a quick bite.
(Waterloo Star) serves northern Chinese cuisine for the Puritan and the homesick. Sparse in its decor and prompt with its service, Star will satisfy your stomach if not your eyes.
This authentic Chinese food! Great food and reasonable prices.  Better than what you get at the Chinese cultural center in Tempe. Never ate a bad meal here.
We'll probably head back to Chandler for our next Chinese food experience.
Minimum credit/debit order is $8 so if you are by yourself getting a lunch special you better have cash.  I only took a picture of the back of the menu, inside is over 100 more items.  They are open until 10 PM which could come in handy sometimes.
We went here for lunch. The decor was pretty cool, although I thought there were too many fish in the aquarium (on one of the press clippings outside the restaurant it said you could choose your own fish to eat - I hope they weren't talking about these cute little gold fish). As for the food we shared a small bowl of noodles with pork and mushrooms ($15), steamed pork buns ($10) and Vietnamese iced coffee ($6). The noodles were I guess hand made and actually quite tasty, but there was barely anything else in the bowl....just some sweet sauce, 2-3 slices of mushroom and 2-3 pieces of shredded pork/dried bacon. The buns were average - edible but nothing special. The coffee was good. The most exciting part of the meal was the fire...so midway through our lunch fire alarm went off. At first we thought it was just a test so we did not pay much attention to it and neither did anyone else (we experienced fire alarm test at Harrah's the day before). But then we heard overhead announcement saying "please evacuate the building" so we asked the waitress what was going on and she said "don't worry, this happens all the time". What, they have daily evacuations!? I don't think she understood the announcement so we asked her to please go outside and check it out (we were somewhat concerned, but apparently not so motivated to check it out ourselves). She came back reporting that everything was ok, but that we were free to leave if we wanted. No one else budged from their seats and so comforted by the crowd mentality we stayed. A few minutes later there was another announcement saying that fire had been contained and to return to our normal activity. So much for fire alarms.
The portions are huge and the price is right. Delivery time is within an acceptable time frame too.
(should be 3.5 star) This is a decent place to visit during winter... That's the short version of my review. 
We ordered chicken lettuce cups, 2 different types of soup and 2 entrees.  They tried to bring the soup out first but I asked them if we could get our app first.  The chicken that came with the lettuce cups was just the fatty pieces of the chicken they don't used with the entree, but all minced up.  The texture was gross and the flavor was bland.  The soups were the only reason this review got 2 stars.  Pretty good.  Wife had wonton soup and I had seafood shelfish soup.  
My friends have always raved about this place for years and I finally broke down and decided to try it and I was pleasantly surprised. I love Chinese food and this place was good. When I got there they set me down and I was immediately served with tea and water(the tea was great BTW) and I ordered one of the lunch specials for only $6 bucks or something. The food was good and the portions were just right for lunch, was hooked until...I went back the next week to get my usual meal and as I was eating I saw a roach crawl on the wall!!! I told the waiter and he said that they spray regularly and offered to move me to another table...at this point I could have left but loving their food as much as I do I just moved to another table and finished my delicious food. I admit I have not been back there since but the food is good! I guess that's the risk you take for cheap Chinese food in Tempe.(they did give me 10% off the meal)
Not much else I can say about the place. I won't be eating there again, but at least I tried something new!
I guess that I am that American that the Pearl is designed to cater to.
I liked it...good chinese food and reasonable portions for a strip casino resturant.  It wasnt amazing, but neither was the bill$.
I should add, when I say food is better than average, it is very good for Las Vegas if you prefer closer to authentic.  The service is terrible.  Dining in China and Japan...the service there is excellent so I don't know what it is about Las Vegas that makes service like something you scrape off your shoe.  :)
When we first go their we were greeted by a nice lady who took us to our seats. We looked though the menu and before our drinks came to us, we were ready to order. 
Service is attentive and good. Endless refills of water for me in this hot weather!
This is a great little old school chinese restaurant.  They have pink linens, fake flowers, etc...it feels like a 1980s NY style chinese restaurant.  Aside from the decor, the food is good.  I enjoy their hot and sour soup, yum!  They are affordable and the portions are a good size.
Our waitress and our selves may have had a language barrier, but their service is very sweet/sincere/effective and also genuinely wanted us to enjoy the meal.
I must have been extremely lucky OR Red 8 read the previous reviews and improved on their service.  After seeing Spamalot at the Wynn, my friend's and I were starving.  With no reservation, we only waited about 30 minutes for a table.  Not bad considering it was Saturday night right before the clubbing hour.  
It was all decent, but nothing was outstanding.  My parents go there frequently, but I haven't been back yet.
tried the beef and onion dumplings today - finally got my lacey top hat - and they were worth waiting for.  Be sure and ask for the special homemade spicy sauce... 
Best Chinese in the valley!!!  Great lunch specials and tasty food period. Their soups taste correct and they make egg fu yung!
The only pro would be that they deliver.  Otherwise I'll keep searching for a good Chinese joint to satisfy the need next time.
Cute little atmosphere, nothing too fancy here. Just order, pick  up and go, or order sit and eat. Simple. We stumbled in about 30 minutes to close and were pleased with the service. Most restaurant employees seem to get upset when you walk in anytime after an hour before close. These employees were kind, and did not seem bothered at all that we were there. 
- House Chicken Lunch Combos: Their lunch combos are an awesome deal. You get your choice of meat, white or brown rice, and then a side, like CREAM CHEESE WONTONS! (Just talking about the food is making me want to go get it!)
The restaurant is always clean and the longest I have ever waited for my food was close to 10 minutes, even when the place was completely packed. If you haven't tried Totts yet...DO IT! You will not regret it!
The chicken was not as juicy as it could be, but not a bad attempt at this dish.  
We had a great view here, seated right in the back so we got to see the Bellagio fountains. Food however, was ok, nothing impressive and not that flavorful. We got family style fried rice, some peking duck, egg rolls, wontons, the usual Chinese-american meal. Service wasn't great, it wasn't even that busy so we're not sure what was taking our waitress so long to bring us waters. Needless to say, we never came back even though we were staying right upstairs.
We started off with the scallion pancake, which was very good but definitely not worth $9.  Next, we ate the hand pulled noodles with tomato and egg, and the sizzling tofu with black bean sauce.  My partner just returned from Beijing a week earlier, and I almost fell out of my chair when he said he ate the same tomato, egg, and noodle dish every week for only $1.  At Beijing Noodle No. 9, it was $12.  The sizzling tofu was wonderful, and the sauce was so good, I ate it up with a spoon.  Yeah, I'm not ashamed to admit that.  You'd do it too if cost you $18.     
Good referral from a friend.  The wonton soup is good.  Ditto the egg roll though it was a little greasy and mostly bean sprouts    We tried the chop suey and chow mein and both were very tasty.   Not the best Chinese food I've had but I would come here again.  The lo mien was good but a little salty.
Although a bit pricey it's worth it for a nice tasting meal in a nice place.
It worked out quite well!  The place oozes "Chinese restaurant" atmosphere.  Like another yelper said, it looks like the set of the place in "The Christmas Story".  The staff was very friendly and the food was exactly what we wanted....tasty American Chinese take-out fare.  Had the Mu Shu Shrimp, Chicken Egg Foo Yung, and the Peking Fried Rice.  Everything tasted perfectly fresh and delicious.  The mrs. really liked the plum sauce and I thought that even the soy sauce tasted better.  It had a stronger flavor than just plain ol' Kikkomann's.  Needless to say, we over-ordered.  Ended up with some loaded to go boxes! It isn't the closest place (10 minute drive for us), but when the urge hits us again, we will be back. :)
For casual and takeout Chinese food, I like Panda Garden for lunch or dinner.  The prices are great, the food is well above average, and the service is lightning quick.  My kids like the soups a lot, and the sesame chicken.  Not the best ambiance (local TV in the background), but you can't have everything.
Wait. All this praise and it's only getting 4 out of 5? Okay, their fried rice isn't all that great (tastes pretty flat) and the won ton soup has some pretty weak won tons. 
I hadn't eaten all day and because the underwhelming size of a previous meal at the nearby Gonzales y Gonzales, I may have ordered too much.  I got a Spicy Rainbow Roll and the Peanut Noodles.  They were both good, larger than I expected, and not under-spiced. Even better, I didn't wake up thirsty in the middle of the night because of too much salt or MSG.
Overall, not a bad deal if you are hungry.
I will definitely be ordering from Baidu again!
I go to the SGV for chinese food fairly often so of course that was my comparison. 
Finally a bomb Chinese spot near my new place. The food was Filled with flavor and the plates was full. The price is also really good. Now when I'm craving for Chinese food I know where to go.
The ambiance could use a little work, in particular the music (it was the radio, and included ads). Despite that, I think my family will definitely be returning in the future!
Service has gone downhill a bit. The dimwitted waitress was not "listening". I ordered 3 items clearly in her language... pot sticker, 8-treasure tofu pot, and one more. The 8-treasure tofu pot was OK... nothing exciting about the taste or consistency.
oh..and if you're hung over, the hu tieu trieu chau (Trieu Chau Style Rice Noodle Soup) will cure what ails ya.
***NOTE:  Noodles Ranch (Vietnamese) is right next door to this place.  It is very vegetarian friendly and has excellent food and ambiance.  Unfortunately they were closed this afternoon, so I could not go there.
All in all we spent 3 hours at this place. We had around 25 beers, and 25 dishes, ALL for a whopping total of $25 a piece, including tip!!!
Thai Milk Tea:
I searched for Panda Express and this location is not listed.
I love the venetian hotel (stayed there 3 times) and I am baffled as to why the allow this sub-par (to say the least) restaurant to continue wasting space there.
Were we order out ~ it's from King Work.  They are always fast and fresh.  The food is consistent . . . and the deliever people are friendly . . . plus the cost is very reasonable.  Blessings to them and the good job they do.  : ) KC
The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the limited selection of drinks available to go but if I could give 1/2 star this would be a 4.5--the deduct had nothing to do with food selection, prep or portion.  Just me...not wanting to stop at an additional place to pickup a drink.
The BBQ Pork and Duck I was very disappointed with.
Hands down my favorite Chinese place I've been to in Phoenix. I've gone through soooo many bad Chinese places in the Valley per recommendations from people who obviously have no idea what good Chinese food tastes like.  I had pretty much given up. I was beyond happy to find this place. The service is fantastic. The staff is sweet, friendly, and often humorous. We've celebrated a birthday here and the staff was kind and accommodating. The food is delicious. The egg drop soup and lo mein are my favorites, but I enjoy everything I eat here honestly.  The prices are great and the food is fresh and they have happily provided adjustments to our orders if we didn't want certain ingredients.  It's not "traditional" it's definitely Americanized food, but it's a complete delight.
Delicious. Can't be the pricing on the lunch menu at a sit down restaurant. Great interior decor that doesn't scream Chinese restaurant. So far I've had the House Special Chicken and Sweet and Sour Chicken. Both were great.
On several occasions, right after my 12-hour work shifts, I felt like having some Asian food nights! This was the place to be! The service has been fast and efficient! The plentiful amount of food has constantly filled my rather large stomach. The best part of the evening was that I was also able to top it off with some nice tasting, imported Chinese beer (Tsingtao).
Chinese food for the affluent located at none other than the world famous Bellagio Resort and Casino.  Normally I wouldn't give a place like this a second thought with its suggested dress code and prices five times the norm, but when Lady Luck intervened I suddenly felt an urge to splurge.
This is an interesting hole in the wall place. I will start by saying that there egg rolls are very tasty!! and the price point is not terrible. I have yet to try any real meals here as I was walking back to work from the post office and wanted a better snack than what I had back at my office,
This is a solid place for Chinese food in Vegas.  The first time we went, we had just arrived from the airport and it was 10pm.  For us, hot soup in our bellies is the best way to sooth a grumpy traveler.  My husband got the noodles with bbq pork - lots of noodles and pork...little veggies and broth.  Great for a hungry hungry man (or growing boy) like my husband.  I got the wor wonton soup - no noodles, but plenty of seafood and won tons.  Personally, I was not a fan of the wontons.  They are minced meat filled.  I like my wontons of have chunks of shrimp or other filling.
My hubby and I stumbled across this place five years ago because we lived in the apartments across the street. We were locals new to the area looking for a good spot to eat.
Took off a star and a half because the novelty of the hand pulled noodle show has worn off and to be honest I don't think the hand pulled noodles taste any better than store bought dried noodles, or dare I say it, not even as good, and aside from the fresh noodle show I don't think the dishes here are that good.  I'll just be going back to all my favorites a few miles further north on Dobson, or just around the corner at Peking Palace - oops I mean Phoenix Palace - Peking Palace is my favorite in Tucson.  2 1/2 stars rounded up to 3.
The one good thing about this place...it's right next door to LJ's pizza, they have some decent pizza, and an all you can eat pizza buffet on Saturdays! Should have wanted pizza...
We will definitely be back for either the take-out or dine-in menu.
Did not want to give one star. Horrible service, grouchy servers..... Worst service ive ever had. Do your family a favor.... Don't eat at golden china..... Especially if your Hispanic
The hot sour soup is a bit too sweet, but hearty and filled with lots of great ingredients, like tofu, shrimp, veggies and such. The mapo tofu was kinda "meh" and tasted a bit off- almost a bit cinnamon-y. The veggie and tofu was great. All in all, a decent meal I'd give a 6-7.
Great food! Great service! I ordered Pork Fried Rice without Veggies. They must have been busy because they forgot to keep out the veggies so I called them back and within 10 minutes the guy was here with the replacement order! Yum! I also tasted my daughters Beef Stickers. Holy cow, so good! On a side note, DON'T ORDER FROM A PLACE CALLED CHINA PLACE. I am pretty sure they don't use "real meat" if you know what I mean. (see my review for them.) I found hairs, small black ones, in their rice, and they refused to give my money back.  Ming's Pagoda is awesome!
Best Chinese food I have had in years. I took the coupon in and had no trouble using it. Very friendly people and VERY GOOD food.  I went there a week ago and could not believe how fresh and tasty everything was. When I walked in I was greeted with a smile, asked if I wanted to have a seat or is this going to be to go. We sat and had one of the best meals I have had in a long time. Went back today to see if that was a one time thing. No, same smile and great service as last week. Ordered the spicy chicken same as last time and it was even better this time around. Hard to believe. This time I also ordered the spicy pork No doubt in my mind, My new favorite. This is the place to go if you want Chinese food.
First time here and all the booths were taken.  The hostess tried to seat us right next to the kitchen door.  Since we were there with family and wanted a quieter spot she then put us in the corner.  Of course the music playing, we were right under a speaker.  This made it difficult for us to converse especially when you have someone with a health condition that makes it difficult for them to talk and talk above the noise.  During the meal we asked if they could turn the volume down and the waiter said he told the manager but we couldn't hear any difference.  
I first went to Wongs five years ago when my fiancée first told me about it. He and his family had been going there for years, and it only seemed right to see what all the hype was about!
The menu however didn't quite cut it for me. I'm vegetarian and there wasn't a whole lot on there that peaked my little taste buds. There's the usual spring rolls, fried rice, and soup you can go with but for such a high end restaurant I was expecting a little more. 
The second time, less authentic ...but still Chinese food, small portion as compare to other Chinese place.
Even their white rice is amazing...delicious, light & fluffy :)
The steamed dumplings were some of the largest I ever saw, filled with a golf ball size helping of ground pork well cooked and seasoned; the wrapper was not thick and doughy like many dumplings and pot stickers.  And there were six dumplings instead of an odd amount, making sharing as a couple nicer.
They have some really cheap lunch specials, but none of them were for fried rice, so I had to "splurge" and pay $5.95 for my shrimp fried rice and I also got a side of crab won-tons, which are usually my litmus test for good Chinese. 
Small, soggy egg roll.
Good stuff!  Had the sesame chicken, general tsa, pot stickers, and crab Rangoon.  All were great, and were ready quickly.
Awesome service and perfect portion sizes BUT the taste of the food could use improvement.
Overall, great service, great prices, great portion sizes and great food!
The place is small and unassuming in a little strip mall.  If you weren't looking for it, you'd never see it.  The staff was all very friendly.  I'm in town on business, so I was dining for one.  I asked to sit at the bar, and they obliged.  
We went during lunch/dinner there were not that many people in there... the waiter was very nice! We ordered Sichuan dan dan mein... it was AWESOME! with the had stretched noodles!
Two stars for the food quality.
Great food and great service!  Enjoy this neighborhood restaurant.  Thanks!
#7 - The friggin huge area to which they will deliver, for a minimal $2 charge (beware their website says it's a buck-fifty, but the gas crunch is effecting everyone)
Restaurant is clean with casual ambience. 
.......Where are the chopsticks?
See what I'm saying? If you spend your hard earned money to buy food it shouldn't be in your napkin and in your garbage can. This is a disastrous eating establishment. Think twice before eating here.
7. The restaurant is definitely busy but not stand in line busy. We were immediately seated and we went on a Friday night at peak hour. 
Stopped in for lunch. Got there just a little after opening so it wasn't busy. Had the fusion rib eye bao burgers and were pretty great. My personal favorite was the salad that came with -Spring mix with a citrus dressing not sure exactly what it was but it was quite delicious.
With that said, I generally get the lettuce wraps here- but ask for extra lettuce if you need it instead of cramming everything in the few they give you (other locations I've been to have their servers do this automatically- after all lettuce is cheap!), and they have a pretty large gluten free section for anyone in your party with wheat allergies.
A cheap chinese food restaurant serves its purpose of providing quick easy take out for lunch, lazy nights or a hungover meal. 
Not enough egg , but other than that acceptable.
Take out ratings only
Really enjoyed this little place, especially the shrimp fried rice and scallion pancakes. Can't wait to go back and try the dumplings (they were out last time).  It seems to be a well kept secret that is getting out. By the time we left, there was quite a wait to sit.
I've been coming here for years. The pork egg rolls are usually very good. My son loves the orange flavored chicken, though sometimes it can be overly sweet. I always like the Four Seasons or Shrimp & Beef in Kung Pao sauce. 
great food, fast service, nice staff. we waited a lengthy five minutes for our food (wow).
I really enjoyed our dinner here!
Dinner-wise everything is pretty fresh and tasty. I have had a plethora of items here. My favorite is the Kung Pao tofu and their egg drop soup is really really good. The west lake soup is really good, but it has meat in it. 
Edit: Based on recent reviews, perhaps the 1-2 star reviews aren't getting their point across.  Here's a list of places you're better off going to:
The spot isn't very clean (the bathroom=complete ew).  The noodles are gummy, the tofu is rubbery...The sweet and sour sauce was kind of good, but I think it added to my stomach ache (which began mid meal).
Lunch specials are available until 4pm daily. It is served with fried or steamed rice and chow mein. They also have egg drop soup with the lunch special but this is not included in takeout orders. Lunch special prices are from $5.95 to $6.50. (The higher priced lunch specials are those dishes that have seafood).
Egg Rolls- I love a well seasoned egg roll. I only ate one, but wished I had ordered a lot more or didn't have to share my other one. Oh well.. 
My friend doesn't drink, and I'm preggos, so none for me either, so the cost of these three dishes alone - $80 something all said and done - seemed like highway robbery.
Service: 3
I admit off the bat that I have a skewed perspective. In my group of co-workers I am the official "C&W ambassador."
-they can have vegetables mixed in
I've been coming here for about 7/8 years now and it's one of the BEST Chinese restaurants in Tempe. It's affordable and the amount of food you get is so worth it. I always get the Hunan Special Chicken and it's never a disappointment. The house fried rice is good too as well as the crab puffs. The couple that owns it is so friendly! They know my family and I because we're loyal customers and every time we go in with the kids they always give us a big bag of fortune cookies, who can say no to that?!
It's my #1 choice for Chinese food in Vegas, and I'm not even a big fan of spicy food!  I always order the wild mushroom soup, braised pork Mao's style, and the spicy fish fillet or fish head, along with whatever my friends like or the waitress/hostess recommends on that day. The entries are cooked in authentic Hunan style, which is boldly delicious and spicy, and totally NOT Americanized. For that reason, some Americans may not like them at all. As a matter of fact, some Chinese who are not from Hunan/Sichuan region also find the dishes too hot to handle. You get to pick the level of spiciness when ordering. Also, you may want to call ahead to make sure if the fresh fish head is still available , and there's no large group of tourists from China coming in the same time you get there.
the food: very good !! good portions. well prpared and full of flavor. also, very good quality product served. good selection and very fair prices.
The second visit, last night in fact, we ordered General Tso's Chicken and Mongolian Beef. Unfortunately, the brown rice was again overcooked. C'mon guys... if I can make good brown rice myself with a crappy $30 rice cooker, what is your excuse?! The General sauce lacked the spiciness of the previous visit and was just OK. The Mongolian sauce was good, but the beef was mushy. It seems like they might soak it in meat tenderizer for a LONG TIME. Very weird consistency.
Wife loves the hot and sour soup
I ordered items that people reviewed on, such as "They have awesome general Tsao Chicken" and "My fav is the crab puffs" 
I have to say that the restaurant in fact is expensive, but nothing completely ridiculous as my husband and I have eaten in restaurants in Santa Barbara with less food and less taste.
Hot n Sour Soup - they usually don't really water down the mix enough, so you get lots of glops.  Gross.
i wasgoing to give this place a much higher rating until i read the latest county health score in the arizona republic on august  26, 2011. the restaurant was tagged with four critical violations, an unacceptable mark. just the week before, i was with a foodie group that immensely enjoyed the aromas and tastes of the various soups, appetizers and entrees we shared. and a large glass rotating plate in the middle of the large round table made it easy for us to try all the dishes we ordered. i enjoyed the sizzling rice soup. thought the corn chowder a bit bland. portions were enourmous, as were the shrimp in the dishes we ordered which included  fried rice, and a spicy sauce. two of the group ordered orange chicken. not a favorite of mine. but they liked it quite a bit. so, if this place can take care of keeping in clean, and maintain the high standards and ingredients they use to cook their dishes, it will be a top neighborhood hangout. but health comes first, and i will not be going back until i see the next score and hope there is improvement.
 Shrimp Fried Rice $7.50
-GREAT food
The best chinese food in the area
The dumplings and wraps were as good as ever. 
Well, what can I say.  I didn't love this place.  The food was very good but unfortunately we couldn't keep the server's attention.
I would highly recommend the soup here.  Mmmm, hot and sour..
When we sat down we noticed that the table was dirty.  We mentioned this to the server and got some strange answer about how people don't use the tables.  No idea what she was trying to say (she spoke very good english).  My wife got some napkins and washed the table herself.  The server didn't even apologize.
Fried string bean - boy, did they use oil from 10 years old to cook it?
Not too shabby for PF Chang like cuisine.  However, I am rating this as a Chinese restaurant so please take that into consideration.
Awesome fried rice and mapotofu! Right inside the awesome pyramid,  the rice resturant is a pleasant surprise! As vegetarians,  we were hesitant,  but didn't have energy to go out and try a new restaurant. So we gave this a shot,  and we are really happy we did. Definitely recommend it!
Been here about 4-5 times now for dinner and  have yet to review, so here it goes-
Moo Shu pork - another of my personal faves
I don't know why so many people give bad reviews to Chen Wok. It's one of my favorite chinese places in Surprise and has been for years. They have a large variety of food and huge portions! I have literally never been disappointed with my order from here. Plus, they deliver. Who doesn't love that?
I only experienced the food as take out.  I was not impressed.  
Like with any ethnic food, there are two types:  Americanized and Authentic.  I happen to love both!  Americanized Chinese food has it's place and for the most part, the American-style Chinese restaurants in Vegas stink.  
PS: They give you free egg rolls if you spend more than $20.
Food - Well, this is where it was somewhat lacking. Reading the other reviews I thought this place would have pretty authentic stuff, but I was wrong. Maybe it was prior to new management/ownership, but certainly not now. We ordered:
Just a warning, anything marked spicy will NOT be spicy.  If you want it spicy ask them to make it extra hot.
NEVER GOING BACK. TOO DIRTY
Food: just had a noodle soup, good, albeit pricey for $15
Forget the Big Chain Chinese Restaurants; this is by far the BEST Chinese restaurant in the Valley serving Outstanding FRESH food with friendly warm welcoming service. Don't miss this one.
The staff is a hit or miss which is awesome for a Chinese restaurant! 
This place is now my favorite Chinese joint in Phoenix. You walk in and the first thought is "oh no. This is not a restaurant. This is a room with chairs and tables."
It was late at night and the girls and I were hungry. I ordered won ton noodle soup and it was sooooo good. I don't know if it was because I was a little buzzed or I was super hungry, but it was freaking delicious.
I'm a Chinese so I know what I'm talking about when it comes to Chinese food. The beef is too soft, it feels like it was soaked in baking soda for way too long. The whole thing does not taste like the chef sauté it or put any effort in it. Basically it tastes like he just threw everything in the wok and poured sauce, stirred it and serve. Im telling you, the China One owner, the beef was just WARM and it became cold within 10 minutes. The rice is not even hot. The bottom is cold. 
the location where The Habit is in now. 
I am a fan of their crab wonton. This classic is done tastefully and not just laden with cream cheese. You can actually identify the crab meat in them! And the sauces sweet with gingery tones. Yum. I went a ahead and also tries their signature rice dish...Uncle something... I don't remember Uncle's name but I'm crying for mercy with the blessing of this light and simply delicious offering . I'm glad they don't spoil this one by trying too many things with it: just good quality ingredients. I had a chicken and shrimp combo.
Really good place, friendly service, good Chinese food. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys Chinese food. Their Thai tea is good as well, and I love the beef with Chinese broccoli. The place is pretty big, there's a lot of tourists who come here so it does get pretty packed sometimes. The manager is really polite and funny, the place is children friendly as well. Great food!!
Very nice people. Food is extremely good.  Restaurant is new,  and very clean.  I recommend the Orange Beef!
I actually this this restaurant could do well, given it is an interesting menu, colorful atmosphere and priced in line with Luxor hotel rates.  Not something I would passionately recommend to friends, however.
Their cuts of meat also weren't of the quality I'm used, giving it a stale taste. My least favorite part, however, was that their chicken dishes aren't boneless. I ordered their Deep Fried Chicken with Dry Chili Peppers, a favorite of mine, and was sorely disappointed.
Well, I made the mistake of eating here sober. Don't get me wrong - it was edible, but only just. I had crispy beef and my friend had sweet and sour chicken, but they both tasted exactly the same. The rice was really cold too, which I'm always wary of following a less-than-pleasant experience in Tenerife with bad rice.
So... Welcome Chinese food again
P.S.  On a side note a visit to the restroom resulted in a SUPER clean restroom which smelled of fresh cleaning products.
Overall, I like to come here for their Orange or General Tso's Chicken lunch specials because you get a lot of bang for your buck and the food is yummy. It's an added bonus that it's less than a mile away from my house ;)
This place is great for students. The portions are solid, though going daily would be difficult on the wallet. 
My first impression was that this was a lot like Noodles and company with a Chinese decor.  It felt it fell short in ambiance and flavor for me.
The orange chicken was very stringy and tasteless. The sweet and sour sauce was runny and mostly sour. The wontons were the only decent thing we ate there. 
Mongolian Beef - Also cooked pretty well. It's not the best version I ever had, but it's on par with better then average. The sauce is good, not overly sweet. And a good percentage of pieces of beef. There were a couple pieces that were a bit on the chewy side, while most were pretty tender. Their version includes a small mix of noodles. Order it if you're craving for some. 
This is a little whole in the wall take out place by NV School of Massage Therapy.  Obviously family run and not a dine-in kind of place but its fine for a quick lunch.  
I ate here for Halloween- it was pretty pleasant.  The wait staff was very entertained when we came in our costumes!  We had made reservations and we were seated underneath the gigantic crystal dragon.  The decor was very oriental yet contemporary.
Saw Noodle Palace.
Why 4 stars? 
Furthermore, even if you don't care that you are supporting a business that practices the endearing of animal species, then you should care that the food sucks. 
I'm not sure if this was just an off day for them, or if it was just the slow lunch hour, but I'll likely think twice before I spend money here again.
Snagged some sushi and noodles and had a nice full meal before going out on the town. This is a great spot if you want to snag a quick table (the bar tables are perfect if it's you and one other person, in and out!). I also recommend Jalea (sp?) nearby.
Their beef noodle soup is authentic and super tasty! Ask the waitor for recommendations to avoid the generic american chinese dishes. They also serve boba drinks! I recommend the passion fruit/green tea boba drink to people who have never had a boba drink. 
After we got home, I opened my food to find big chuncks of beef, chicken, and shrimp in my pad thai. I'm a vegetarian, so that's not good. My wonderful husband took it back for me and when he returned, I only ate about 5 bites. Wasn't good at all. Next time, I'll stick with Pei Wei. Maybe I'll have that for lunch!
We could not believe there was a Shanghainese restaurant in Vegas. We were just driving around and I noticed in huge Chinese writing for xiao long bao $3.95. Hubby said "let's go eat there". I'm like "right now?" He's like "yeah". It was 4pm and it was neither here nor there, but I complied.
I had about 4 slices of beef and my noodles were skimmed...ALL veggies! WTF! I paid around $5 for the worst meal of my life and it left me hungry still.
After a few years we eventually went, and the food is by far and way the best Chinese food we have eaten in Edinburgh. The service was great, but it comes back to the food.
We're from New York where Chinese Food is amazing at most restaurants. We've had trouble finding food like that in the West Valley but finally, after 12 years, we found Shangri-La and now we're hooked. Nice, clean and tastefully decorated with friendly and usually quick service. And did I mention that the food is great? Give it a try!
Cheap, tasty Chinese food in the Asian ghetto just off the Strip.  It may not be the best Chinese food ever, but it's the best I've had so far in Vegas.  The chow fun in particular for only 4.99 is a must-have.
My favorite meal here is the shrimp with lobster sauce.  The order always comes with so many, plump flavorful shrimp and the sauce is lip-smacking good.  Pair it with an order of Yang Chow fried rice. Seriously delicious.
Greens steamed with garlic - simple but good. Gotta have some veggies. 
AMBIANCE. You just have to check it out for yourself...let's just say: amazing. 
The delivery took about 40 min, which is typical.  The best part is that the food is FREAKIN' AMAZE balls!  It's some of the best Chinese I've had in Vegas.  The ONLY thing that made me give this 4 stars were the pot stickers.  They were huge and the insides were yummy, but they were slightly undercooked so that the top part dough tasted not completely done.  If they had just been cooked more evenly, these would have been amazing.  As they were, I had to pick off all the dough and just eat the outside and the bottoms.  
This is easily my favourite Chinese restaurant in Edinburgh.  It's hugely popular with the local Chinese community who flock here every night of the week because the food is just so authentic.  When I first came here it was unlike any other dining experience I've had.  The reason it's got 'Hotpot' in the name is because they stick a steaming cauldron of salted broth in front of you and you then order raw ingredients which you then cook inside it.  
We had an early Saturday afternoon dinner.  Restaurant was moderately busy, but the food was wonderful.  We had the Sweet and Sour Chicken and the Mongolian Beef.  A bit too much food coloring in the Sweet and Sour Chicken, but the taste was great.  They also seemed to use a very good cut of flank steak for the Mongolian.  Very tender... a few too many onions, but that's not a major problem.  The mother / daughter team who waited on us were great and made every effort to make us feel comfortable.  For an ordinary looking strip mall style restaurant, we loved of the food and probably will be back.  The restaurant appeared to be clean although the rest rooms could be tidied up a bit.
I'd like to see this place succeed because the food is GREAT and the staff is very nice.
Authentic, delicious.  If you like spicy Chinese food this is the place for you!  There are dishes that are not spicy also, but Szechaun cuisine is all about the heat!  This region specializes in spicy food.  If you don't like spicy, or can't handle it, I understand but you're missing out.  Definitely coming back here.
The best chinese restaurant in VEGAS!!! When I'm in the mood for good chinese food or have company visiting from out of town, this is my go to spot. The service here is OK, typical asian resaurant lolz  but the food is yummmmmmmy!! 
Best chicken wings, mongolian beef and kung pow hands down.  
at 250
I'm new to the area and didn't know what my delivery options were. Based on the reviews, this place sounded like a home run. I was so disappointed! The food is reasonably priced, they deliver for $12 min, and delivery was quick, so it warrants 2 stars. I also love the fried noodles they included with my soup. Unfortunately, everything about my General Tso's combo was subpar. The meat was all dark meat, and some of it quite fatty. The fried shrimp that came with it tastes old, as did the rice (and who messes up fried rice?).  In the unlikely event that I order from them again, I will steer clear of the chicken!
I didn't realize it until I sat down that I'd be here before (this might happen to a lot of people with late nights).  The food is... okay.  I tried the wonton soup and a side of BBQ pork.  The BBQ pork was definitely the highlight since the wonton soup was a bit weak on flavor.  My friend made a much better choice in selecting the congee.  I know congee isn't for everyone, but it's a much better option than I had.
Anyway, I don't think management really cares about the quality of their dishes since they business is so good.
Not even sure where to begin.  BAD.  VERY BAD.  Most of the meats were a gray color, the hot and sour soup was mustard yellow somehow...and we waited FOREVER for bad food.  After we'd waited thirty minutes, the waitress came out and said they did not have any more of the entree we ordered.  That took you 30 minutes to figure out?
The Hubs and I ordered Chicken Lo Mein, Spicy Garlic Broccoli, Szechuan  Shrimp and Chicken Curry. 
New owners errr! Don't even speak English !
Service: sloooooow. Tookd them forever to seat us (Okay, maybe not that long, I was just uber hungry and impatient). Took them a while to take our orders and bring water out too even though the place doesn't look too packed.
It was also mad empty with only two or three other groups of patrons.
Like I said food is wonderful here! The prices are not expensive! My favorite dishes crispy kau chee cake noodle, minute chicken, cold ginger chicken, and there spicy pork chop! 
We've been coming to Amlee for years; it's our go-to place for Valentine's Day and other special occasions.  Our business had it's big 25th anniversary party for all the managers here and had a fantastic time. Great food, not a fan of the fact that you can't bring your own booze even with a corkage fee (their offerings are not great), but we managed to pull it off.  You haven't LIVED until you've had the Chinese Chicken Salad, and my husband swears by their Orange Chicken, shrimp puffs and Amlee Beef.  
First I would like to say to everyone that complains about the service is to please stop bitching about it. Yea most of you are stuck in American ways and things should be set in a certain way everywhere. This is a AUTHENTIC Chinese food restaurant, it's not they are being rude or don't want to come back every 2 mins to make sure you are ok it's because there is literally 2-3 waitress's working at a time. I've been here probably 50-60 times since its my fiancé favorite Chinese place in phx, and shes from china and hates Americanized Chinese food, but every time I've been here when it's slow or packed I only see 2-3 waitress's and sometimes a helper here and there. So just be patient. 
If you enjoy below average noodle dishes this place is for you. We went here thinking it would be a reasonably priced meal before our show and we were less than impressed across the board. Calamari balls appetizer were better suited for playing jacks. The noodles were spectacularly unimpressive. They brought us a plate with basil so wilted we had to ask for some fresh to use for or meal.
I am a Bay Area native but found the local station news segment which focused this restaurant on Dirty Dining.  The cleanliness could be better but it's mostly attributed to the place needing an update of the furniture and silverware.  They food is decent and the prices are reasonable but there are more places on Spring Mountain Road to explore.  Recently, I was turned off (hence the lower rating) when we had a big group which required us to sit on two separate tables and my cousin paid for both tables and included the tip on the one bill and as we were leaving the waiter kept on saying we didn't tip.  When we finally spoke with the cashier she said agreed with us that the tip was there for both tables.
I had a desire for greasy, American Chinese food and this place delivered. Thanks Tom. I had no idea that this little gem was sitting on Gammon Road in Middleton. The only complaint I have is that the fried rice was a little salty. The chicken was white, tender and he kept the sauce separate. That is huge! The rangoon were excellent. Its been so long since I have written a good review I am a little at a loss for words. I will say his prices a little high, he thinks he is PF Changs. His food is ten times better but his prices are on par. Oh well, Thanks Tom. I may return.
hole in the wall..definitely take out instead of dining in..food was made fresh & huge portions..fried rice was good..sweet & sour chicken not so much..general tao chicken tasted how dogs smell :( wont return
I went there for their lunch specials and got the sweet and sour chicken. 
So sad :(  All you Arizona natives know this place.  Remember the round tables with the waxy tablecloths? The waitresses were quick and efficient and the food came out in waves, but it's different now.  Order an egg roll and you'll notice it looks like a deep fried Twinkie, try the chop suey and it's time for a game of Find the Meat .  Things are quite different now and, unfortunately, the owners don't seem to care if you like it or not.  I'm sad and I miss the old Sing High.  Without China Doll to fill the void I'm at a loss for good Chinese food in the downtown area.  I need a time machine.
I ordered an iced green tea, and it was pretty dull. Flavorless. Maybe I should've gotten something else.
Chicka the China, the Chinese CHICKEN! 
Some of the best food I have had anywhere. These guys don't fake it.
I really like this place.  The pot stickers, onion pancake and the pork patty are my favorite dishes.  Everything is really fresh.    The owner is really friendly and will help explain dishes to you that you might have questions on.  I have also gotten the frozen pot stickers to take home and they were good too.
(on a side note, all of our other dishes we ordered were of edible quality. We had udon noodles with xo sauce, fried chicken wings, chow fun, etc. Not the best, but at least it was edible.)
The restaurant was nice, the decor was nice, but we've seen this a 1000 times.   Cookie cutter upscale chain food that's available at every mall in America; dressed as a smaller, hipper version of what we already know so well.  The menu was smaller than the big-shot chain up the street, yet it seems the distinguishing factor may have been three sandwiches added to the menu.  Was this their qualifying factor for the use of the term Pub?  
The iced tea tasted like poor tap water.
They take standard dishes and add high-end ingredients and interesting flavors. They are very consistent (never had a bad meal). All the dishes are wonderful, you can't go wrong with anything.  Particularly good is their Wor Wonton Soup.
The noodles may be good but the kung pao chicken was a total dud. Wildly expensive at $18.95 and not nearly as good as airport fast-food Chinese. The dish was sweet (not spicy) and gloopy. The chicken had no saute marks. I think it was boiled.
Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce- my go to favorite but alas the kids ate so much of this so quickly that I only had a bit of a taste. Crispy and crunchy with just the right amount if oyster sauce for a subtle salty flavor. 
BF and I got Beef Cubes with Pepper Sauce with Tomato Rice and Pork and Mushroom E-Fu Noodles.
One bite took me back 11 years. To a very young man of 19 and his friends. Just coming back from a California road trip and stopping at their then favorite eatery. Ordering our favorite dishes, annoying the proprietor with our laughter and naive inconsideration (we didn't know better back then). Coincidentally, I bumped into one of these old friends there, this trip. 
Amazing food! Get the Pot stickers and the chicken and broccoli dish! Probably close to my favorite Chinese food place next to my house! (: I recommend trying them!
They are very fast and everything is fresh-made--not sitting in a pan ready to heat up for you.  The employees are very nice and patient when you can't make up your mind.
During our visit, a server dropped some glassware, sending it into a thousand broken pieces. Flo was right there to monitor the cleanup and insure no-one stepped on the glass. 
---Jjajangmyun(a steamed noodle in black bean sauce, with diced pork, onion, potato, & garlic,,serves with cucumber pieces on top): not salty at all, all the ingredients were blended well together and gave a perfect taste of Jjajangmyun! 
Can't wait to try more!
You don't come to New York New York for the Chinese food.  But if you find yourself needing some, this is probably the best and only alternative within the hotel.  Located right in front of the New Yorker Tower is Chin Chin.  Now it can be a bit confusing to see the name then to also notice the sushi bar inside is kinda confusing... so you would think this place is fusion themed but it's not.
I love this place whether its for weekend dim sum or for a great dinner. I have been going to Golden Buddha for a few years now and while they did have a period where the food wasn't so great they definitely have stepped up their game. On the weekends  they have traditional dim sum, although you can still order off the lunch menu as well. I have been there several times just for dinner as well and I have to say they make my favorite dish, Mongolian Beef, just perfect. Some of our other favorites there are the walnut shrimp, string beans with XO sauce, Singapore rice noodles and lobster. The atmosphere is relaxed and the wait staff is always very friendly.
Making a special trip to come here 1/2 hour from where my wife and I live tells you it's worth it.  The lighting is kind of dim but intimate; the decor nothing fancy, but warm.
Next on the list were Spicy Sichuan Pork and Spicy Sichuan Fish, both rated hot, hot, hot. The bowls arrived at our table. The pork turned out to be pork belly--unsmoked, uncured bacon--apparently boiled in grease with a few vegetables added to contrast with the reddish fecal color. The fish, tilapia, was served in another bowl of the same disgusting grease, in which it had apparently had also been boiled.
Love this Restaurant. The food is authentic.  Remember, make sure you order Hunan dish like Hunan dried pork.
When we finally got there, we opted to sit at the noodle bar rather than wait 20 minutes for a table, because we were both starving by that point.  It was fun to watch the chef hand stretch the noodles, and I told my BF, look! they're hand stretched, they're going to be so delicious!!
Ate here twice on recent LV vacay.  This is a great place to go after a long night of whatever it is you were doing.  Open till 3 am, I believe.  Reasonably priced comfort food.  We tried the won ton mein, roast duck, fried rice.  All good.  Located on the main casino floor of the Venetian.  Adding this place to our LV eat list.
So tried I did. And never again.
Their prices did increase when the move occurred but I think most people expected it, their previous location was bursting at the seams.
The restaurant is small but cozy. The owner made us feel very welcomed. He spent a great amount of time checking on us and explaining everything. Very nice and sincerely. 
This place was good with traditional Chinese noodle dishes. The menu is quite large, large enough for you to go with people who are not huge noodle fans. The dishes are a little bit expensive, even though you expect it to be a little high-priced since you're in the middle of the Strip in Las Vegas. For the amount of food we got, I'd expected the prices to be a little lower. For one, you may get one noodle dish and an appetiser to be fulfilled. For two, maybe one more noodle dish.
The kung pao chicken was okay.  Huge portion but a tiny amount of meat.  It was basically kung pao veggies.
Last night my wife asked me if I wanted anything when she was going out shopping, I said, "sure get me some egg foo young/" We'll she brought me home some of the worst egg foo young I have ever eaten anywhere from Yunan Wok. She has been begging me to stop there for weeks since she got a flyer in our house door. I checked it out on Yelp and it confirmed much of what I had already thought, too expensive and even worse the food reports were awful. 
The egg drop soup is delicious. They will make it Vegetarian if requested (water base instead of meat broth). We just love that soup!
Stay away. There are several restaurants nearby that are inexpensive and worth it.
I dont really have nothing to say about the FOOD. Their food is amazing i just got a little bit disappointed about the service the last night i ate here. Dont get me wrong i always eat here with friends and family theres a lot of good server but my last one hmmm..
I was visiting in LV and this came up on my GPS and was close.  It isn't the fanciest place, but compared to some of the small Thai restaurants I dined at in Thailand.... it was, and brought back memories....  The Thai restaurant in our small town has a green curry dish that I love, so does Chai Tips.  It was as tasty, but they use dark chicken meat, ours uses white meat, which I prefer.  I'll probably return if I get back in the area.  I also got to embarass myself with some of my much forgotten and broken Thai with the cashier.  Kinda fun!

Overall (5 stars)
Wynn Las Vegas has an array of excellent restaurants - all of them expensive.  Red 8 tries to fill a niche by providing good food at a modest price, relatively speaking.  Many dishes are in the $15 - $20 range, although there are a few luxury live seafood items that will set you back almost $100.
my first review..  i read them alll the time on here, and after following some reviews and decided to eat here.
Dim sum sampler was fantastic but a tiny bit greasy (im just spoiled with the hundreds of dim sum places nearby my house so with these ive become picky)
Like one reviewer noted before, this restaurant is on a par with those of Singapore, which is high praise indeed. Real, authentic Chinese in Las Vegas, your better believe it! :P
Other dishes I've enjoyed was the mushroom dish that is cooked in pork fat. 
Food is really good but Damn the service is really terrible. This is my 3rd time here and I thought they were just busy before but as much as I enjoyed the food, I wouldnt recommend it to anyone. Wait time for your food is crazy  then they bring you food you didnt order, so u wait, only to tell you that your food was probably laid on someone else's table so u wait some more. Food came, you asked for a bowl and took another century to come and had to physically tackle the server on the other table. You wait some more and the bowl was probably still in the factory. Worst part, Nobody even apologized. Another incidence, ordered food and never came in so you cancelled it coz the appetite just went away, check came in and they still charged you for it and they even fight you and say they delivered it.. OMG. I guess have your food to go? Wheres the management here?
Food comes out nice and hot and the tea is decent. The place could use a bit of a shine up for sure. Prices are good though. I would go back for sure.
My experience here this past weekend was mediocre at best.  I arrived at the Chinese Cultural Center at about 4pm, after Dim Sum had ended at the Golden Buddha, so I decided to give this place a try with my Taiwanese boyfriend and visiting family.  The prices were a bit of a rip off for the portions that were served.  I order the vegetarian chow fun for $1 extra than it would have been as "chow mein."  I'm assuming we just received the American menu, but who knows?  The service was conducted half in English and half in Chinese, which is typical when our mixed race party shows up at a Chinese restaurant.  I sampled the lemon shrimp my father ordered.  The sauce was a bit too sugary, like lemon drops, and the shrimp itself had such a thick, hard shell of batter that it was hard to taste the shrimp.  No drinks were suggested; we were left with only the water that was refilled every 5 minutes.  When we boxed up some leftovers, they did not give us the rice to take home, which makes me wary that it is being re-used.  A child was with us, and there was no kid's menu, which was a bit of a disappointment.  The food overall tasted alright, but I have definitely had better (and better service too!)  Nice try, but I'll stick with the Golden Buddha or something closer to Chandler.
On the board the prices are written,
Don't hesitate to ask about dishes you don't see on the menu.  A member of our group is crazy about General Tsao's chicken and the chef graciously prepared it for us anyway.  Amazing customer service!
Seemed to be a language barrier when the guy didn't understand that I also ordered fried wontons, but then we realized he just wasn't paying attention.
I have been on a Chinese food kick lately, and with not a lot of Chinese food in the area, Qwik Chinese is really my only option.  My coworker is in love with this place and has been raving about it for months so I decided to give it a try.  I have been three times now, and while I like some of the dishes, I have been very disappointed with the rest, especially since I think Gary who runs the place is just such a nice guy and I want to keep coming back.
Sam is one of the best Asian chefs in Nevada: a genuine purist with the highest standards and a deep sense of authenticity. 
I had a really fun dinner here on Saturday night with four girlfriends. This is the perfect spot for dinner before a night out. We shared several things but the highlights were the seabass, the vegetarian dim sum, the sweet and spicy lobster and the chive noodles. Skip the truffle duck. It was a huge disappointment. 
Good food and value!
The food was so bad it's the first time in my life I have ever called a delivery place for a refund and to pick up their unedible food. Absolutely disgusting! The food came in a bag full of its own juice (spilled over) the kung pao celery (since the handful of spongy undercooked chicken pieces were hardly visible) our order was incorrect with no cream cheese wontons and some foil wrapped thing I think may have been chicken instead of the bbq robs we paid for. The only thing that may had been edible, had the other dish not completely saturated it with juice, was possibly the fried rice but the shrimp didn't taste cooked. We finally said to each other "this food isn't edible" and broke down and called. Dont waste your money, you will be disappointed!
The sushi on the menu was just average but it was kind of what I was looking for and the other chinese food was just a bonus. 
10 Service
- green beans - yum 
Anyway, the food was nice for a quick stop in but I think I'll order to-go next time I try something else on the menu here.
We ordered during dinner with appetizers so it was over $10 a person, but their lunch specials are generally around $6-8/person.  We had Pork Roll (YUMMY!! I recommend this!!), Tom Yum Soup (tasty, but we won't order it again), Lemon Chicken (Yummy for the many tender cubed pieces of white meat chicken.), and the Traditional Singapore Rice Noodle (HUGE bowl of dry curry noodle.  It was good :) ).
Being Asian, I judge Chinese restaurants by the service (which isn't great in amazing chinese food restaurants) and whether they speak the language.  Szechwan Palace met both these needs.  I understand the Asian population in Phoenix isn't as huge so they'd need to have the Americanized menu.  The soup was amazing and we even ordered an extra to go.  Anything spicy that you order will be SUPER spicy so be cautious when ordering.  It's authentic enough for me to want to come back here although I haven't tried any other places in the area yet.  I didn't understand the canned Lychee dessert at all, where's the mango pudding or the almond jelly?
This is TRUE Chinese cuisine not nouvelle or fusion.
You served yourself for the water in the cup on the soda machine.
Love love love their takeout! I've had dinner in their restaurant once and it was decent. The restaurant is a bit outdated but clean and super quiet. The food is the reason I stick with this place. We always order the Kung Pao Chicken - all white meat, the Teriyaki chicken - all white meat, and the Orange Chicken. We do get their crab puffs every once in awhile and their egg rolls are mediocre as well. Their sauces are really good and the meat they use is good quality - I'm particular with my meat! 
Duck sauce! Quack.
I'll probably give it one more try since it's the closest Chinese place and I'm sure my fiance (who's out of town this week) will want to give it a shot, but I don't have high hopes for my repeat experience.
Came in for a lunch meeting, possible opportunity with this company. Met up with my acquaintance here since he works for the Wynn and everyone knows who he is around there. I arrived first and there was a table reserved for us. I'm very observant so I noticed all the workers are Asian and the food is very traditional Chinese. Most of the diners are Asian families. Getting the theme.
Ate here with my fiancé late one evening.  Excellent restaurant...delicious food and a nice wine list.  Ambiance was very nice...classy, elegant.
I love that right after we sit down they bring the tea, and there's no extra charge like a lot of Chinese restaurants these days.  This place does offer a great deal for a LOT of food -- we went with the Family Dinner special which was 11.95 a person for soup, eggroll, fried wontons, pork chow mein, fried rice, and sweet and sour pork.  By the time the entrees came around we were totally full and we ended up taking three full cartons of food home.  The service was prompt, attentive, and very friendly.  
This place is my favorite new Chinese delivery place. They got a huge menu and i have not found single thing that doesn't taste amazing or amaze the person we ordered for.
The environment was rather... drab. Though the booths and chairs were all clean, but it felt like they designed the place so that customers are encouraged to want to take food out instead. 
However, like the other reviewers I can't give this more than 2 stars since the place is so filthy.  In all seriousness, the service was friendly but I had to keep kicking a cockroach away with my foot during dinner.
I'm not up half the night gulping water like some kind of African beast at a Serengeti watering hole....after a rain...in the summer...in the midst of a drought.
I think this is located next to Noodle Ranch which gets glowing reviews for ultra fresh asian food.
Pros - Great taste, portions are just right.
A great place to get some American Chinese food. This is the best I've found in the valley. I usually order the house chow mein (get ready for some serious broccoli action!) and the peking pork; I am planning on being adventurous and trying spicy next time, since the medium is fairly mild. The service is super fast, and I always go home with leftovers. Their lunch specials are perfectly priced and the portions? Well, they're perfect, too. Get ready to be happy and full. Dinner is a little pricey, so I gave them 4 stars.
The food is very tasty.  Their chicken is all white meat which is very rare for an Asian food establishment, especially when they aren't charging extra for it. The spiciness can be adjusted to taste, from warm to sweat pouring into my eyes hot. 
The owner is friendly and so are the servers; many of them have been there the whole time I've been going.
This is my second order, and by accident. I ordered from them months ago and swore never again. 
My experience of Chinese Good Food was far from a treat and I next time I will go to the other cheaper and tastier Chinese takeaways in Edinburgh.
Based on the Chinese food I have experienced in Arizona, this place is holding the top spot for now. Ordered the Black Pepper chicken and it was just like it said on the menu - strips of chicken breast lightly fried and coated with a tangy black pepper sauce. It also had plenty of onions and peppers and a free side of rice. Great dish. I also sampled the shrimp egg roll and it was crunchy and had lots of good ingredients inside. About 12 bucks total and the condiment area is a nice touch. Always hated asking for more soy and duck sauce from owners.
I ordered the General Tso's chicken (standard I know). It was ok. A little bland, but if you are not a fan of spicy food then it would be for you. If I ordered it again I would ask for them to kick up the spice. My colleague found the heat level just right. 
I would come back considering I'm 2 minutes away. Hehe. =)
Great place for good Asian cuisine and people watching!
I stopped in for take out last night and what a surprise. I checked out some of the bad reviews here a few months ago and just figured that I would stay away from this joint. 
Go with someone who's been there before the first time or get ready to spend a little bit as you sample dishes. I've really never eaten anything bad there, although a few choices have been tough to chow down on.
Service is pretty good, we got drinks and a menu right after we sat down. Their dim sum selection isn't very great, but they do have most of the standard ones.
   This visit to Panda Expressed got the job done. As I head into the monotony of having my health card renewed, I am now filled up and relaxed.
* The portions of the fried rice and chow mein/fun are big. A typical person will not be able to finish it alone in one sitting. And the price is reasonable, considering the yummy & large portion of food you get. Food is good and perfect for lunch and dinner.
I took my father here for dinner because I had heard so many good things about it. The restaurant was relatively slow when we arrived. We were sat by a very friendly hostess and waters were promptly delivered. Then we sat at our table for over 15 minutes without receiving any further service. I had to ask the hostess to find our waitress for us.  Once they finally came over and took our order they hardly seemed apologetic for the neglect. In addition to having to wait so long to even place our order they forgot my order when the food finally arrived. I will not take anything away from the quality of their food but the service is less than up to standard. Id recommend getting take out.
 I started off by ordering 16 boiled Pork and Coriander dumplings with 8 Chicken Fried dumpling. I also had a Chicken Chow Mian and deep fried aubergines.
Decent food at a fair price.  The hot and sour soup is really good.  Their egg rolls are HORRIBLE though.  The service is so-so and a little slow.  It's average as far as strip mall Chinese restaurants go.
Stir-fried Black Pepper Beef Ribeye with Merlot:  Love Me Tender.  Tender is the night.  Tender Love.  Time, Love and Tenderness.  Tenderoni.  I would've included "Try a Little Tenderness" but there was nothing little about this.  It was A LOT of tenderness.  Every freakin morsel was juicy and delectable.  I also liked that they included big pieces of garlic mixed in.  To fully enjoy this dish, you should order a side of jasmine rice for $2.  
It should it should be called china trash for the absolutely disgusting food.. Nothing but a whole bunch of Mexicans fighting over crabs  and shrimp will never come back hopefully I wont diarrhea warning stay away!!
I ordered the pane fried noodle with chicken from the lunch menu, thinking this is a staple of their menu and should be a good entry to their cuisine.
Best Chinese Delivery in Tempe. Broccoli shrimp is delicious. Do not order online thou. My order did not go thru and I had to call it in.
I ordered take out and it was a little bit of a hassle that the restaurant didn't have a website so we could see their menu and call in our order but I figured I'd just suck it up and wait the first time and then get a menu for the next time (little did I know at the time that I would throw away the menu with the food later). I ordered Kung Pao Chicken. It was flavorless and mushy. The meat was slimy and tasted like it might have been out of a can with no distinguishable difference between the white and dark meat - assuming there was actually white meat in here somewhere.
It's REALLY hard to find good Chinese food around the South Scottsdale or Arcadia area. This place is the best of everything I've tried around here.
I wish I knew how to quit you, Panda Express. 
--spicy squid, a specialty, has no oomph, just greasy glooph. even the sliced jalapenos are mute
- Service: Always good. 
When we arrived, we were welcomed by everyone, including the owner.  They have a nice little bar area, and the waiting area has plenty of room if you have to wait for a table. But we didn't have to wait since we called forty-five minutes ahead and made a reservation.  After all, it was a Saturday night. I loved, too, that they had live instrumental music which was perfectly toned and didn't interfere with conversation.
They had a special with 99cent Milk or Thai Ice Teas and the milk tea was pretty good that BF and I had two of them. We also got a Fresh Fruit Napoleon which was fresh cooked Phyllo they stacked with cream and fruit and had extra fruit on the side. It was a good and light dessert to end it. 
This is a gem of a place!!!!!!!!  No MSG, and all of their food is fresh and very flavorful!!!!   I am amazed at the quality of all the dishes!!!  I dont't love broccoli but the way they cook it and the freshness of it I eat it up like its my favorite!!!  Please support this family owned and run business, they deserve it because they offer great Chinese food!!!  Just be patient because they are family run it is not fast food...  Great food made with TLC takes time but it is always worth it!!!!!   I am a customer that loves to support places with great food and this place is on the top of my list for Chinese food!!!!
I thought this place was way better and fresher tasting than Panda Express. I didn't know what to expect walking in but walking out I gotta say I was pretty satisfied. The lunch specials are decently priced especially for the amount of food they give you. Gotta recommend this place over any Panda Express any day.
The pad see ew had pork rib that was prepared similar to Chinese red-cooked pork, with the skin being red and a little sweetened.  I have actually since a similar style of pork at an authentic Thai restaurant served on the Thai (no English) menu, and the added flavor made the dish a little more interesting than usual.  The Chinese broccoli was just a little passed due, but I've had worse at LoS, so not docking any points here.  The only real complaint I had was that this dish was a little greasy for my liking.  Overall though, it had a good taste and I finished the entire dish.
I think the service is mediocre, and what's more I dislike the owner.  I think she's a complete idiot and a snob.  Three times (twice by phone, and once in person) I would ask a question and get the wrong answer.   Very simple questions like, do they take a certain credit card, or like what time does the lunch special end?  She should not be answering the phones!  If the lunch prices weren't so cheap, I wouldn't go there.
this place is located in the corner of a stripmall on the edge of chinatown. i have driven by for years & seen their huge banner waving offering cheap teriyaki rice bowl specials.
- awesome service
We were genuinely hesitant going here. Some of the recent reviews were bad. Our experience was very good. We started with the rangoons, they were good. We had the sweet and sour chicken and the broccoli chicken for dinner, which were very fresh and tasty. We only order dishes with white meat, so I don't know what the others are like. We also tried the New York style egg roll, it was just ok, maybe a little greasy. Overall we would go back.
Delivery times vary, I usually receive my order 35-40 minutes after ordering, only once did it take about 55 minutes in the evening.
Perhaps it was an off day.
Tried this place out. Not too bad. Got sesame chicken and egg rolls.  One day I will find real egg rolls in this town, but this is not the place. Sesame chicken wasn't bad, but not great. Service was super fast and friendly. Will go here again, but won't go out of my way to do so.
can i give 6 stars?
Service is rude, hassle to serve you, no thank you for order just a rude look when you pay. Food isnt good. Poor service, bathroom dirty. Food was cold and waiiter said they couldnt help. I wont come back again. China Gourmet is better on Nellis.
- not exactly cheap
I must admit, though, that the food was not necessarily memorable. From what I can remember, it was decent and I felt perfectly fine the next day. Not sure what previous reviewers ordered there, but my stuff was fine! Unfortunately, it was not necessarily memorable either... Although I did have this cool rice soup (?) what was extremely steamy and came out sizzling! They had decent plum wine and hot green tea, too :)
We always order the sweet and sour chicken (all white meat) and the vegetable low mien with a side of crab puffs and fried wontons. 
I had the lunch special Sesame Chicken... no crap chicken here. It was great. There was so much, I even took some home.
Note: the prices are very,  very low. Quality is excellent. Cheap is a poor description.
- not enough alcohol in the specialty drinks
And, what was most insulting was the "fried rice" was just an ice cream scoop of steamed rice with something brown squirted on top.
This is NOT the buffet that used to occupy this building. This is a full-service restaurant, and although it also uses "South China" in its name, it is the antithesis of the 2-star buffet establishment that used to be here.
The Fried rice was your basic rice with peas and chicken and was good. The broccoli beef was also good. The Almond chicken was delicious! I had the perfect mixture of flavor. 
Do not give this place a try!!!!

I got the passion fruit smoothie with boba which was quite good (I love bubble tea so much and this place is pretty legit).
Great, fast service, and good food makes this the go to chinese when in the area
Lunch $6.99, Senior $5.99.
This is a great, no-fuss neighborhood place. The staff is friendly; the food is good and consistent. We've tried a few different chicken dishes and they were all very tasty.
I usually don't eat Chinese food that often because now that there are more Asian cuisine to choose from, I prefer Thai, Vietnamese or Japanese. However, when I do want something Chinese, I go to Asian Cafe Express. Of course the only thing I order there is the spicy Mongolian bowl. 
Great Noodles, this hidden gem has fresh noodles and a unique style; not afraid of spice. I'm all for this secret pleasure.
In comparison to the food from couple of days ago, this could have been labelled as being great.  
I think this is one of the best Chinese Food restaurants I have ever eaten at. The staff is always friendly, the food is always excellent tasting and the speed of service is outstanding. I have eaten here over the past 3 years and I still drive back to this restaurant even though I don't live in the neighborhood anymore.
All in all, they are one of the better delivery options around my neighborhood and I'll continue to patronize the place.  The people that own/run it are nice.  I suspect they may be a little challenged by the economy, which might explain why the quality has slipped over the past few years.
The only part that is lacking is the obviously one of the most important, the food.  It's not horrible but it is defiantly not the best.  Food quality almost seems like a midway point between your local rice/noodle to-go shop and an authentic Chinese restaurant .  In other words, the food just isn't that good.
Sizzling rice soup was great! Chicken fried rice was really good. Take out was fast and the prices were reasonable. I'll be back to try other entrées.
Thank you Diana Y. for the Review (I also hail from Wash D.C. area and miss the food...Don't get me started)
Best American Chinese joint in the area. Orange chicken is bomb.
My wife, daughter and I stopped in for dinner. 
It's good to know that I can get authentic Chinese food near where I live and the location is excellent. The only issue I have with the restaurant is that I wish parking was more accessible. From the times that I've been here so far, it seems like a toss up as to whether or not you get a decent parking spot near the restaurant. Other than that I do recommend Mr. Beijing as they really do cook up some great food daily!
We started out with some free house soup.  Was very good.  
No stories, no wacky convo's, no random encounters with strangers.  Just a very solid establishment that I'm a huge fan of and I will continue to go there as long as I live in Las Vegas.
Come on yelpers if there is a better place to eat then you need to tell me about it. The decor of the place  was so cool and different. Unlike anything I saw on the strip. The wait was a little long, but it gave me time to shop in the meantime (30 minutes). Take cool pics with the gold fish.  
4. Bo Cai - Sauteed spinach with garlic. Fairly typical, the kind of spinach that makes your teeth feel like they've been scraped. Good to get a little green in  there. 
Stopped in here for a quick lunch one day while driving by the area, and for the total of $9 I spent (including tip), I was happy I made the pit stop.
This was the closest Chinese food place to us and after getting the mongolian beef lunch meal and  a side of pot stickers I will make the drive to get better food. It is over priced and seems more like a fast food place and not an actual restaurant. The menu said the lunch special came with egg fried rice. It was not fried rice and the mongolian beef was the worst I have ever tasted. The pot stickers weren't bad, but they were fried instead of cooked/steamed on a pan like they should be cooked.
The food:
Wow!  Great authentic Szechuan food in Arizona.   The water oiled fish with peppercorn was truly numbing.   Cumin beef was delicious.   Highly recommend!
I originally ordered the Homemade Tofu, but the owner(? chef?) stopped over to the table and said he recommended the Tomato Egg Noodle Soup.  I again asked if there was chicken broth or anything non-veg and they said it was ok.  I honestly wasn't sure if I was going to like it since tomato and egg doesn't really seem like the best combo (scrambled eggs with ketchup baffles me)- but I decided that I was in for adventure.  So, I heeded the words of the random guy.
I had the water boiled fish that I tried to order last time, it was very good and lighter than the water boiled chicken I was given last time, both those dishes seemed very mild and far less tongue Thrilling compared to the Chicken hot pot but they were also flavorful and were lightly tongue thrilling.
I also think they could do a better job with making the place feel cleaner. Nothing bad... just needs the attention to finer details to push it up a notch.
Sigh..
Fish Filet Congee
My boyfriend and I went on our long travel.. approx 5 minutes down the road and sat down.
The staff is also so wonderful. Very friendly and accommodating. The ambience is extremely lacking, which adds to the charm, in my opinion. Total hole-in-the-wall, diamond in the rough. Doesn't get much better than Asian Cafe Express.
I would definitely eat at this cool little east-coast-style chinese restaurant again.
Average and  expensive. I would almost suggest paying for a cab to get you off the strip and enjoy a more authentic Asian experience. Ambiance was fair. Portion sizes were healthy but the chow fun noodles didn't really tickle my fancy. Lacked the flavor depth I was looking for in a restaurant in this price range.
The pan fried noodle was sooooo good. Crunch noodle, soft beef and cai lan (Chinese broccoli). The salt/peper pork chop was crunchy on the outside and yet juicy inside. Will definitely come back to this place to try other items later. 
First off, I have to say that I was totally impressed with the decor inside. 
For those who don't know what Hot Pot is, from Wikipedia: it consists "of a simmering metal pot of stock at the center of the dining table. While the hot pot is kept simmering, ingredients are placed into the pot and are cooked at the table. Typical hot pot dishes include thinly sliced meat, leafy vegetables, mushrooms, wontons, dumplings, and seafood. The cooked food is usually eaten with a dipping sauce. In many areas, hot pot meals are often eaten in the winter."
The boneless ribs were out of this world good. Reminded me of NY chinese food, except better! My dinner was delicious, the sesame chicken was tender and flavorful, and my mother loved her sweet and sour chicken. 
Overall: pretty close to AJ :/
We ordered food from this restaurant for my son's birthday party. The owners forgot about the order day of the event- due to their neglect, we didn't get the food we ordered, my husband ended up missing 45 minutes of our son's party. The owner did not ask for payment when my husband got the food- so we thought reasonably the food was free to compensate for their mistakes. We do not hear from them for almost 6 weeks then they called our house day and night demanding payment. Oh yes, it gets worse- they ended up suing us in civil court over a bill that was less than $200!! It was a total nightmare experience. Don't have any dealings with this restaurant!!
Conveniently located near Highway-95, this Panda Express doesn't stray far away from the others.  The best part about this particular PE is that it has a drive-thru open until 10pm.  Try to sneak in a minute past that, and they won't answer; not even to tell you they're closed. *shoulder shrugs* I drive past this specific one on my way home from Church on Thursday nights and I almost always get a craving for it.
- Kung Pow chicken was very good with just the right amount of spicy flavor for me.
BOTTOM LINE:  The food is truly amazing.....when/if you get it.... even cold and mildly stale, it tastes good.  The problem is GETTING it.  Ordering either by phone directly, or online from grubhub.....it is a gamble.  No matter how great the food is, it becomes irrelevant if you never get it.  I really wanted to give more stars but the food is so good, but the service and HORRIBLE delivery experiences ruin it.  If it were just one or two bad experiences, I could understand....but this is consistent, horrible service.  Unforgivable.  There are too many other options in the area to waste money on this place again.
Spicy Ying Nan Noodle Soup- NOT spicy at all. Tastes pretty bland. Its not seafood broth or chicken or beef broth. Can't really distinguish what the base taste is. Even with 2 generous scoops of Chili sauce it wasn't really spicy. I would skip this next time, however other people liked it.
Wow...
I ordered the steamed tofu and fish. The plate came out hot, but oddly the fish was lukewarm, and the tofu underneath it was cold. The waiter took it back and apparently they just reheated the same dish instead of making it over. As a result, the fish was not as perfectly cooked as when it came out the first time although everything was warmer. Granted, perfectly steamed fish is not an easy thing to do, but if it's on the menu I assume they know what they're doing.  The flavor and quality of fish was good, I just wish the execution was better. 
A big plus is that your food is made to order, unlike Panda Express where the food is already prepared and they just scoop it into containers. The food definitely tasted like it was just made, with exception to the fried rice, which was dry.
Came here last week for lunch with my family. My aunt had an ad from the newspaper which offered a free dessert if you spend over a certain amount. The first waitress did not want to honor it. The second waitress honored it, but they ran out of ingredients for it. They ended up giving us shaved ice w/red bean, taro and tapioca.
-Dinner can get a bit expensive so I suggest you eat lunch here.
One of my friends took me here after raving about their parent's passion for this place and how they have been going here year after year.  Oh my god!  This place is sooooo amazing!  The owner is so sweet as well.  It's authentic, delicious, and really reasonably priced, too.  If you even think your left overs will make it to your house (or even the 101) think again.  This place is just plain awesome!
I was a huge fan of this place the first time we came by last year and was very excited to have found a deelish whole in the wall.  Since that first visit though they have managed to dissapoint me. The service is fairly quick but their food quality  has gone way done. 
I have to go back to try other stuff again, but I won't be ordering appetizers. For $2 more each appetizer, I can order another bowl of noodle to try.
Just as delicious as Dragon Island was. Very good service, yummy food.
Always excellent. I reserve 5 stars for anything that wows me. I should give China Chili 5 stars because they're always reliable. It's a good good spot for transplanted East Coasters like me who like Chinese comfort food without an overgrease laden spoon. Love that they know how to pack mushu to go, no added instructions or confusion. Meat & seafood are always fresh, well cooked. Vegan dishes are just that, vegan. No muss, no fuss. The chef can make a dish to order if it's not available on the menu!!! We keep going back for: hot & sour, YuShang, Salt & Pepper, old standards. Their specials are great.  We always try a dash of anything different than what you can't get anywhere else and have not been disappointed yet. Overall very happy we found this gem in the desert!
I opted for the Vietnamese Noodles with Steak and Shrimp. This was one of the best dishes I've ever had at PF Changs. Angel hair type noodles, loaded with shrimp and tender pieces of steak. The sauce was truly memorable. Since this is a seasonal dish it won't be featured on the regular menu and that's really too bad.  I also had to have what I always have when I go there-  a cup of wonton soup which this time was flat and bland. 
Here is the thing: I live in Austin Texas. You know what the best Chinese restaurant in Austin Texas is called? PF MFing Chang. Yeah... exactly. Therefore, when I leave Austin Texas I'm on a mission for Chinese food. Not beef and broccoli but REAL Chinese food. Therefore, when my buddy asked where I wanted to go my only answer was an authentic Chinese restaurant and KJ Kitchen was PERFECT. 
I walked here from a few blocks away around 12:45 PM on Thurday.  The place was dead and only had one table occupied.  I was greeted immediately and the woman asked me if it was my first time, I said yes and she went over the menu and their best sellers, also mentioned the 10% "discount" if you pay with cash or credit.  I give them 5 stars for customer service but the food is another story...
If you are in the area, craving some Chinese food, stop here.  That's it, this is by far some of the best Chinese food I have had in Arizona.  If that does not get you motivated wait till you see the prices....
Yeah, it's definitely one of those places where if you need service, you flag them down. You don't wanna sit there waiting for them to assume you need something.
The service was excellent!
Unfortunately I have to agree with Felix and Ashlee. We stopped here for lunch while visiting Madison.  The food was not very good. I had shrimp with peapods and the shrimp was not flavored at all, it was like they had taken precooked boiled shrimp and put it on the dish after it was finished. We also got a chicken dish and the chicken was not good at all. It was so poor that we couldn't even eat it. Wonton soup often has meat wrapped up in the wontons at this place the wonton soup was just wontons.  Seeing reviews that this is the best or second-best Chinese food in Madison does not speak well for the Madison food scene. I would not come back to this restaurant again.   The location is good, the service was good, but the food was not good at all.
Anyway, about the food, their seafood noodle soup is very good, you can request egg noodles instead  as we always do. I highly recommend the lamb chop appetizer. Awesome. House special Chow mein (pan fried Cantonese style) is also great..
I walked in around 7 pm on a Thursday, the place was empty. That should've been my first sign I guess. I see that they have the usual Family Dinner A/B like all Chinese take out place have, which is usually what I get. So I got a Family dinner A stay with my usuals and see how Pumi tastes - with ChowMein-crispy noodles and Sweet Sour Pork. 
My personal choices are red won ton for appetizer. And Singapore Mei fen for main course.
We have ordered a variety of items from their menu but our favs are: cashew chicken (w/extra cashews), flamingo special chicken, egg fried rice, veggie chow mein, beef & broccoli & their egg rolls. You can't go wrong if you order any of them, yummy!! 
It gets crowded during dinner so best to come early.  Good portions, reasonable prices and service was fast, but don't expect too much in that category. Credit card accepted and plenty of parking.
 Prices are ok the place is clean...
We ordered take-out from here last night, and were blown away by the flavor and quality of their soup!  Also had an order of egg rolls, which were pretty good, but their SOUP ... Oh-Em-Gee ... Their soup won my heart and my tummy with the first spoonful.  
Food flavor spot on
If you're in Caesars Palace, see the cool decor here and then eat somewhere else.
I don't have a lot to say here...I ordered delivery and should have known better than to order Chinese delivery.
My wife had the chicken fried rice and very rarely does she give a negative review, but even she said it was her least favorite yet.  I noticed she had to put extra soy sauce on to enjoy it.  
We planned on going to a Touch of Thai which was located next door. That restaurant went out of business so we ended up here. 
This little gem is HIGHLY recommended not just for the great food, but for the very friendly staff as well.   It's gotten to the point where we walk in and the Baked Pork Chops are already being cooked and it's just a matter of what new things we want to try on the menu.
Nice atmosphere and pleasant service but the restaurant is generally not very full.  Carry-out is their big business.
Chinese Green
Only thing is, the food was just alright.  It was overpriced for what it tasted like.  Not that it was bad, but for a restaurant on the strip that prices itself be up to par with other strip restaurants, their food did not deliver that caliber.  It had a couple unique ingredients used in general Chinese dishes, and that was about it.
Two words
Put back into a corner its hard to find but well worth it cause the food is delicious
Pros: Egg Rolls were great, Chicken Skewers were delicious, and the Pork Fried rice was good.
Must order: lamb dumplings!! You can't go wrong with it!
The one star is for booze only. 
Lief had zogezegd de Pekingeend, ik de beef with asperagus and black pepper. Vooraf - weer ingestonken - pot stickers en fried shrimp. Zeg maar iets met ogen en maag. Way to much. Dat moeten we echt niet meer doen.
Beef tongue - Delicious, packed of spices, and spicy! I love it! The spices could be a little strong. It was a tad salty for me. Maybe it was better to eat with rice. 
Average food, terrible service - in Vegas you can do much better eating in most other places
I don't want to judge to harshly but I know my 808 peoples from Hawaii may not like this Americanized version of chinese food.
Our group of 6 was put into that little bird cage thing in the corner. Let me warn you, they WILL forget about you if you do. Appetizers consisted of the turnip cake + jellyfish/chicken.
Yummiest sweet and sour shrimp I've had in a LONG time. The BEST spring rolls!! And the sweetest gentleman delivered my meal :)
I like Big Buddha for its fresh taste, price, portions, and speed. I love it when I call in an order and when I get there (only 5 mins away) its almost always done I rarely have to wait for anything. I'm not real big on there fried rice seems like its just like the white rice with some Soy sause mixed into it... But over all a go place to go.
30 minutes into dinner, Christina W. (aka the Duchess of Wendy's) sent me a super lag tip to try their fried chicken wings, fried bread, and Tom Yum fried rice. My meal was so delicious and filling that I didn't have any regrets that I missed out on Christina's tip.  But looks like I'll be back because if it's good enough for the Duchess, then it's good enough for me.  
I went to this place at 7pm. And most of the food was cold or warm some hot fresh food. That was good but not for 10.75.  The only thing was great was the ice cram.
Unfortunately China China Restaurant is no longer there. It's now China Buffet and I would NEVER come back here. The only thing edible was their cut oranges. So we basically paid $8.95 for a plate full of oranges. I'm fearfully of how my stomach is going to be tonight...
However, when we sat down and looked at the menu on the table, it was a completely different menu. Not only were there less choices but the prices were also ridiculously high (close to doubled the price) compare to the menus posted. 
This by far is the best authentic northern hot pot I ever had in Vegas. The value was great, getting so much food for around $10. Lamb skewers brings back memories when I was in China.
While the food is good,  my experience with the wait staff was extremely disappointing.  I was with a group of six so when the bill was brought to the table we added a 20% tip and divided by six.  We each contributed the appropriate amount in cash and triple checked for accuracy.  The busboy came and took the tray with the $168 in cash.  Shortly afterward our waiter returned to the table and slammed the tray down, accusing use of not leaving him a tip. His voice was was so loud patrons at surrounding tables turned to view the scene.  When we explained we had left him a substantial tip he all but called us liers.  No matter how we explained what we thought had happened,  the waiter refused to believe us and continued treating us rudely.  One member of our group was so embarrassed over the incident,  he left an additional $25.
This place is very small, and the tables some what crowd what little room there is. This is, however, my new takeout place. East coast style indeed.
When we walked in, the first thing that hit me was the dank smell. It made me wonder if their fish tank was leaking, or had leaked in the past. This put me off a bit. But I went for it anyway.
 I go to Panda Express near my home a couple of times a month and like it better than most fast food places.  There was a line at this one and she said it almost always has a line so it must be pretty popular.  One reason may be you can kind of depend on the consistency of flavor and quality here.  And she said if you are concerned with how long an item has been sitting they will make some up fresh for you.  That's handy to know.
Best pulled noodles ever! that was sooo delicious - texture, consistency and cooked just right.  The fried rick was also fantastic - surprisingly (I mean, I am after all Asian and I always go to chinese restaurants and have had a multitude of variety of fried rice).  We also had the pork belly with the clear noodles - the meat was tender and the sauce was simple and understated but complemented the dish very well.  The pancakes were also tasty.  Staff was friendly and accommodating. Would come back and eat here again.
Came here when I was at a conference here. It was a delight to find this place at the hotel. Food is authentic and tasty, and being  right in the hotel is such a convenience! It's been difficult to find quick, authentic Chinese food at Vegas short of heading out to Chinatown. Now I've found this place I'll definitely come back when I crave Chinese food in Vegas!
2 Star: 
Could ask for better chinese delivery! I ordered Hunan at 8:30pm one night just because they were nearby and I'm super impressed. This is the place in Tempe for chinese food!
The rice was not cooked properly, the rolls were all open in the back and the final taste, at the end, well, was....terrible.
I think we ended up spending over $60 dollars on all the above. I know its Vegas but that's just ridiculous. Not coming back.
I am again, completely baffled at the discrepancy between reviews and the reality of this place. I rarely review anything that I wouldn't give 4 stars but this place was expensive, the portions mediocre and there was little to no taste differential in anything we ordered. 
This is a very good Chinese restaurant, we have gone there for years. I am shocked by the bad reviews and would suggest you ignore them, this is good Chinese food!
First of all They close at 2 am, perfect for my coworkers and I to get a late night meal after work. They have a wide variety of  food, from the run of the mill to very exotic bites.  The prices are fantastic and the service is quick and easy.  Last week I took my friends there and we ordered Mongolian beef, jelly fish, salt and pepper squid, kung poq chicken, hong kong style noodles, pork chow mein, half of a bbq duck and walnut shrimp.  Everything came out quickly and nice and hot.  Hands down the best Chinese food you will get in vegas.
I need a volunteer who can show me what to order at Chinese restaurants like this.  I can order at panda express, but these type of places I am confused.
On my first visit here, I ordered egg rolls and a stir-fried beef noodle dish.  It was such fun to watch noodles being made that I couldn't wait to bring Mom over so that she could see it herself.  Service was friendly and helpful, and the place (and restroom) looked very clean.
Its the only restaurant I will go and order only one dish!! The Hunan Special Chicken!! Nothing else! Sorry no recommendation for other dishes here from me! Tried them all and didn't like it too much! Basically I had better on those other dishes!!! lol! I know Hunan Special Chicken is the best dish there and everyone I've took with me has liked it!!! What more can you ask for 6 bucks and a big serving!!! Make sure the chicken is fresh thats because if its been sitting for awhile it will be tough chicken! Oh yeah make sure to eat the food fresh! If you save it for later it does not hold its taste or texture!!!
Average soup, average sauce and very limited choose of meat and veg.
This is one of our favorite luncheon spots.  Our favorite meal:  Edd Drop Soup, Chicken with vegetables, Steamed Rice, Egg Roll.  Service is always fast and entrees are reasonably priced.  Usually pretty packed at lunchtime...a good sign.  Noticed that they seem to have a good take out service.
The egg drop soup is boring.
I was greeted as soon as I entered by a lovely, friendly young waiter (although I sound like one, I am not actually an OAP...) who gave me a take-away menu to look at and left me in peace whilst I made my choices. The food was ready pretty quickly and handed over with a smile and some free prawn crackers (nice one).
The food is okay, and the place try's to present itself like a Panda express.  They have crab Rangoon, and it's set up where you can get a variety of different things. The food is okay and the prices are good, but the last time I came here the service was awful.  The guy was filling to go orders while a line grew like 5 people long. I didn't mind, but he was sorta crabby when he waited on me and I had to tell him I wanted orange chicken like 3 times.
My only complaint is the occasional sewage smell outside the restaurant.  I think it's fixed now.
XLNT Food Fast Delivery always Tasty
I had a bowl of wonton noodle and two spring rolls. The noodle and wontons are both great!. Especially the wontons have very thin skinner, in which tasty lean pork and big shrimp are wrapped. The spring rolls weren't good enough, but I still like to give this restaurant 5 stars. Definitely I'll go back. I used to go to hong kong wok (an OK place) for the same type of food before I discovered this. I think Wah Kee is way better in both taste and price.
Good NYC style Chinese.
Seriously?! Dress code for chinese food? I just came to get a bite to eat and they refused service. Price is high for chinese food and no matter what they try to do its still just regular chinese food.
i will def be a regular w that kung pao, yum yum yum!!!
Additionally, I wasn't given (or offered) any packets of soy sauce (or any other sauce) or chopsticks. I suppose you just have to know to ask for what you want before you walk out. I also had to wait an additional 15 minutes longer than the "20 to 30 minutes" I was told it would take on the phone. 
I grew up enamored of the original location located at I-17 and Cactus.  It was my family's go-to Chinese eatery in the 80's and 90's, we'd eat there every couple of months. Even though I moved out of the neighborhood, I'd hit Shangri-La for lunch every so often in the last decade while I was nearby on errands.
Best time I ever had was in this restaurant! Me and my husband  booked our valentine's dinner with them and we had the most wonderful experience . While dinning , you could hear and see the Bellagio fountain running, the food was ok, and everything else worth going! Love it, highly recommend it!
Fast (including delivery)!  And reasonably priced.  We've been going to Asia Lee for a few years now.  Love the fact that they deliver.  Cause well sometimes you just don't feel like leaving the house, ya know.  
it looked gross
I arrived at Hsin Cafe around 11:45. They were not very busy. There were two occupied tables and two people that entered behind me. The woman at the counter was friendly and kindly answered all of my questions about the menu. When I asked about the veggie dish, she even offered to put tofu in it. Must have changed their story after Leslie F's review! (Another win for the Yelpers!) 
I don't think I would ever go back here for chinese food unless i was desperate
Awesome food and service. The stir fry is AWESOME
Certain dishes are good, others are not. You have to try a few different things and see what you like. Their sweet and sour sauce is quite terrible but not really a concern to me. I wish I could give a half star to make it 3.5 but it is what it is. The service is actually what makes this place. Always a pleasure to order.
I really like the food here but as other's have mentioned, this is a pretty low-frills place with a very particular (and unappetizing) smell to it. However, the staff is always friendly, the prices are reasonable and they bring your food out super quick. Your first time here (and if you are not used to authentic Asian noodles) you may feel like the noodles are undercooked and a little chewy but once you get used to it you'll realize they are much better that way! If you order the thinner noodles then it is less noticeable. I can recommend anything off the "stir-fry" section of the menu. Even those used to American style PF Chang's will like those options. I love their dumplings as well but as other reviewers have mentioned they are humungous and you get six of them so only order that if you are with a group of hungry people!
The lunch is $4.99 plus tax.  A few of my favorites are the lo mein (shrimp is my fav.), shrimp or chicken and broccoli, kung pao, and chicken with cashews.  Usually I'll ask for everything extra spicy and they have no problem doing that.  I've tried almost everything on the lunch menu, and only not cared for one item, but it's just because it's not my thing.  Everything is made to order and is delicious.  As for the sides, the fried rice is great and the egg rolls and wonton soup are awesome.
Why I didn't give it 5 Stars.  1st time I have been there.  Parking wasn't very good at all.  We had to drive around the small lot a couple times.  People were parking in the fire zone.
stayed at the venetian for a weekend. im so disapointed i didnt try this earlier in my stay.  came back to the hotel really drunk and hungry, we went to the cruddy pizza joint in the nearby food court.  the night we left though, we decided to try it. awww man the soup here would have definetly hit the spot after a night of drinking. beef noodle soup:  spicy broth, tender beef, good noodles. and its open late! would have really wanted to try more of the menu. we sat at the bar area and watched all the orders go out. next time im in vegas, im coming here late night forget steak and eggs.
Very disappointed!  I've had a carry out each of the half dozen times I've eaten here, so don't  know the dining experience, but decided that it was the last time.  I usually get the Sweet and Sour chicken and fried rice.  The Sweet and Sour chicken is usually soggy and the fried rice just OK.  So, tonight I decided to ask for the sauce on the side when I placed my phone order.  When I got there, they charged me almost 2 dollars more for the privilege of having the sauce on the side.  I mentioned this to the clerk, and to the lady in charge, that it would have been nice to been told that when I ordered it.  They both said, sorry, but it's only a dollar.  I said, no it's almost 2 dollars.  She just smiled and walked away.  On top of it all, I got less food as well.  Very expensive place for what you get.  I won't be back.
Red 8 is the sort of place that isn't necessary special enough to travel to from, say, the Mandalay Bay -- China Grill there is as good if not better -- but when staying at Wynn or Encore or even Venetian, it's a great place to go. We have always enjoyed it; we first tried it when the buffet had a 90-minute wait and Red 8 had only a 20-minute wait, and we love Asian food anyway. The service is effiicient, though nothing special, and the food is all good and simple. We've enjoyed the grilled platter, sharing the duck, chicken, and pork, all delicious. My husband loves the chow mein noodles, and, when feeling unadventurous, I actually like the fried rice. The nicest part is the price -- we can eat very well and get out for well under $100, which ain't easy at a non-buffet place on the strip, or at least one with good food. Highly recommended.
So far my experiences at this restaurant have been very good.  I can understand that the decor is a hit or miss situation.  Those fish I tend to focus more on the food though, and this place did very well in my book.   I love their Shiu-Mai and the Salt & Pepper Fried Chicken.  I have also tried a few of the Noodle dishes, braised beef, soya chicken, roast duck and a few of the fried rice dishes ( regular, beef, seafood).  Mostly good dishes, nothing really as pleasing to my palate as the Shiu-Mai and Fried Chicken that I favor.  
I wanted to pay for everything and accept my fault, until the server placed the receipt, coughed on my face, and told me to pay a 20% gratuity which no restaurant had ever done to their customer. You simple leave the check, walk out, and whatever you get, you get. Since he was rude I thought I'd speak up about what I didn't like, so an Asian manager lady gave me a half price off the wrong order made. You can say it was better than paying a big price for something you didn't like.
DUHH, I was almost done the casserole dish... too full to have another one. and who knows if there's gonna be another piece of garbage in that food.
Review #23 of 2014
Favorites:
Solid option.  I live on the east side and delivery is limited.  Chang Jiang is not the greatest place out there, but it is decent.  
This place is not expensive. I don't know why people say this place is pricey. If it was any cheaper I'd think the food was recycled.
The Szechwan Chicken I couldn't eat because it was extremely sweet and could have passed for a dessert sauce.
Decent enough, I would return. Definitely more friendly for takeout/delivery than dining in.
The staff were real nice.
Ambiance: Great for a chinese good spot
Patti's not a happy girl.  Knew they were making changes to menu but gee whiz, didn't think the changes would be as plentiful as they wound up being.  
-Their hot and sour soup is absolutely divine. 
Chang Jiang is good, solid Americanized Chinese food. It's not the best Chinese take out I've had, but it works.
Honestly, these guys could dominate the local market for traditional chinese dining if they'd just clean up a little and spend more than five dollars on the interior decor.  All the handwritten signs all over the walls advertising prices on fresh "geo ducks" and shrimp, along with the harsh fluorescent lighting, are just over-the-top carelessness.
The salt and pepper shrimp is outstanding, the flavor is like nothing I've had before.  Highly recommend that dish.  The orange chicken is also very good, if you like spicy chicken get the spicy fried chicken!  It's crispy yet chewy, great texture.  The fried cheese wontons and the dumplings are classic, you can't go wrong with this place.
I will definitely be back!
They deliver, which is way cool in my world!
My order was ready to go the minute I walked in the door. Everyone was very friendly. All in all, a pretty great spot!
Food was good. I'd go back to try other items on the menu. 
Great food with perfect spice.  For an appetizer I had the Pork Wonton.  This is not fried but steamed.  Great flavor and excellent burn.  For an entree I had the Pork Eggplant with the hand formed "pigs ear" noodles.  I could not stop eating.  A large portion that was excellent.
Pros: 
Pan friend buns, also delicious
We have been coming to the Dragon Noodle for years. The food is good, the prices are a little high and the service is okay. I agree with some of the other Yelpers. If you sit in the back section of the place it is a bit gloomy. We liked the place before the remodel. It had cheesy decor and t-shirts for sale. 
The sushi was so icky. The ahi tuna was BROWN. I could barely choke any of it down, and ended up leaving most of it. My friend's steak was thin, tough, and cooked to oblivion.
They were great when they first opened, but went downhill quickly.
Boy, this place went downhill fast. Did they change owners, cooks & food suppliers. Food is gritty, sauces are thick and/or slimy and the chicken is not cooked all the way. What a shame. Won't be back, until things improve.
Penny pinching people. 
I ordered the sesame chicken and requested extra crispy...but it wasn't (maybe they didn't see where I wrote that request in on GrubHub). It was still very good though. I think I was expecting the sesame chicken to resemble the yummy pictures of orange chicken, but it didn't look anything like it. 
This place is down the street from me and I decided that I wanted Chinese Food, so I placed my order online and went and picked it up.  This is my second time here and I like the food and the service.
I think Asian fusion is overrated to begin with, so I didn't find this place any better or worse than a PF Chang's or Bamboo Club, food-wise. The prices were on par with both those chains, and their offerings similar as well. I wasn't starving so shared the Ahi lettuce wraps and fried wontons (with real crab) with a friend. The wontons were excellent, not too greasy with a good balance of cheese and crab inside and wonderful sauce drizzled outside. The Ahi wraps were nothing special, in fact I found the filling to be nearly flavorless. Everyone else at the table was incredibly happy with their entrees - that included the meatloaf sliders, evil jungle princess (yes, she totally ordered it just for the name), and the sizzling salmon and asparagus to name a few. Aesthetically speaking, the sizzling salmon looked absolutely incredible and the perfect serving size.  
Great food, good service - I had Sesame Chicken lunch special - Reminds me of Chinese food back in Chi-Town.  Excellent value for the $, but maybe the person answering the phone could have a bit less attitude, ;-)
Everything tasted totally "off"... even the fried rice, which quizzically had none of the ingredients I'm used to it having. The water tasted dirty and I saw 2 NASCAR t-shirts while I was here (these set my "check engine" light on immediately).
Great staff.. Very Attentive..
Good quality food for the price, very nice people and just an overall great place to eat at. The only problem is how CHEAP most of the customers are for not leaving tip, arguing about the price, being rude to the waiter/waitress, having no manners and just overall being a complete asshole.
Anyhow, I ordered the chow mein lunch special with fried rice and won-ton soup, an additional order of chow mein, an order of spring rolls and and order of chicken with snow peas and mushrooms. The guy on the phone stated that it would be about 45 mins to an hour. This is a little above the average delivery time, but I figured that because they're a small, local business that it was somewhat reasonable.
We discussed our options from a menu with a decent variety.  I was attracted to this place solely because of the gustatory possibilities of Broccolini in Ginger Sauce.
Enjoy!  I can vouch for the beef and broccoli.
This is my 2nd time ordering take out. The 1st time I got orange chicken the second Mongolian beef. Both times the food was hot, fresh and tasty! You can't beat the price either. I want to try the chow mein next time but I def recommend this place :)
Service is great but is a but pricey, but you are in Vegas.
For lunch, I got the General Tso Chicken. It came with that, soup, rice, egg roll and cream cheese Rangoon... For less than 7 bucks!
Cool.  But I came for the food.  And that was awful.
Traditional, Lobster-Potato Cake or Florentine
- Hard to find. it's in the back. I had to go around Smiths just to find it. lol 
- Great value for money
I called in the order and was greeted by my friend Asian Lady With The Inappropriately Loud Voice, who after rushing me through my order and snapping at me when I tried to explain (for the fifth time now) where our office was located, would interrupt my giving of the credit card number by reciting numbers that in no shape, way, or form resembled the ones I gave her. You know, to keep me on my toes.
But as I pulled forward and the dreamy drive-thru girl handed me the plastic bag full of sweet saturated fat and hydrogenated oily goodness... well the heat of the leaking cardboard containers must have melted my heart. And after eating the whoooooole thing, I found myself forgetting the 20 minutes of annoyance... and just remembering the good times... specifically, the 10 minutes of stuffing my face. 
Service was alright, but it seemed like a pretty slow Monday night. Prices are in the $10-$15 range for most dishes, which is not as bad as I was expecting for a hotel restaurant. I'd probably head across the street to PF Chang's before I come back here.
I'm sure the food would be better if you eat IN the restaurant, but the next time I need an American-Chinese fix I'll be heading elsewhere.
Buffets don't get much worse than this.  My wife always says that I'll eat any Chinese food, and generally she is correct.  I know the difference between fair, good and excellent food, but I enjoy all three when it comes to Chinese as long as the price matches the quality.  I decided to try Golden Dragon because the AYCE Chinese buffet that I had been eating at had some health/sanitation issues that I began to notice.  Golden Dragon is inexpensive for the lunch buffet (+/- $6.99 with no drink included) but, for me,  the attraction ended there.  the staff seems slightly perturbed that you're there and after tasting their food, I was more perturbed than them.  Food is generally tasteless, of the lowest quality and almost everything I had was dried out/hard, even though I was eating during the lunch hour.  This place is a definite AVOID, as the highlight was the egg drop soup.
Wonderful dumplings!  Great service as well.  We had the soup and the stone dumplings.
Their Thai Tea isnt bad, its good on a summer day! Dont get me wrong starbucks is around the corner, but I'd rather pay $2 for a big cup of tea vs $2 for a grande (and I love starbucks!). Its nice to know that good chinese place is around the corner from work
I'm not picking on Chinese in Madison but this is typical bad Chinese that you find on the south and Midwest.  Tasteless slop for the fat buffet people.  Best Chinese food can be found in the northeast and the west coast.  This stuff sucks.. Goto Burger King which is close by.
I will never EVER eat here again. Even Panda Express is heads and tails above this nasty food.
I would definitely recommend this beautiful restaurant! our server Daniel was absolutely amazing... he made our night. He was so helpful and polite. 
Inattentive waitresses with attitude. Ick. The sizzling rice soup was delish but everything else was just fine. I mean, it's Chinese food. There's bad chinese food and decent chinese food... but hard to really make anything excellent. Not any more "authentic" than anywhere else, but that said we stuck with americanized dishes like chicken w/ veggies and chow mein. They definitely have more options for more authentic stuff like shark's fin soup and abalone though if you're feeling adventurous. But regardless, I doubt I'll be back.
We liked it. We ate here before the Carrot Top show. We had a little Chinese and sushi mixed together. The spring rolls and curry rice was very good. So were the few rolls we had. The mango crab salad thing was the best. Good tropical type drinks also.
Service was fast and there was some nice patio seating in addition to the inside. Great for lunch or a fast casual dinner.
The food was packaged nicely, and was warm. 
5 Stars because this is a unique take on Chinese food and some dishes were amazing.  The depth of those dishes is unlike any Chinese food I've ever had.
I am a real fan.
Oh Mr. Chao...you really let me down.
I am so dissappointed that PF Changs has removed the Salt & Pepper Prawns from the menu. My husband and I went there specifically  for this entree'. Too bad..... Not sure if we will return. We usually order the orange chicken with the shrimp. I guess we can get orange chicken anywhere.
The spring rolls did indeed taste homemade and were great. Their hot and sour soup was just the right consistency and didn't taste "cheap", if you know what I mean.
I can't believe that I haven't read a review that mentions that the ceiling cut-outs are completely nauseating! We actually had to stare at the table to keep from getting sick! Also, the tanks of goldfish kind of put me off my meal... Usually a restaurant that has tanks actually stocks fish it serves in said tanks. As we entered, I immediately thought, "Please don't tell me they serve goldfish here." The food was okay. It was fine. Not worth the price tag and there certainly wasn't anything about the ambiance that would bring me back. Save your time and money, oh, and your stomach.
Hope your dining experience is better than mine was.....
Love this place! We just moved into the neighborhood and was looking for a good Chinese place. Their noodle bowls are filling and delicious. You must go.
flavors are great and food is abundent and soooo reasonable for that family of 4 to go out and enjoy. a meal out.
EVERYONE is happier at Nee House these days and the karma is better because of it!
The waitress never came back to check on me and no hot mustard was on any of the tables nor offered to me...tried to catch a waitress, but was unsuccessful.

My wife and a number of friends were in town for CES this year and decided to go to dinner at Blossom after getting drinks at Minus 5 in Monte Carlo.  I had never been in the Aria, so seeing the beautiful hotel for the first time was great.
The Story:
The best Chinese food in Phoenix.  I want down to the Chinese cultural center and found the food bland and almost processed.  This food is fresh and homemade - simply great!
Great prices and huge portions!  Love it! and they deliver
For real, I can't say enough about this place, what a great, REAL Chinese Restaurant and WE WILL MOST CERTAINLY BE BACK many, many times over.
Or, if you must go, don't expect authentic food.
The main thing to point out is that everything we ordered (both visits) they were able to say "yes, that's gluten free" or "no it's not".  They even prepared a gluten-free version of one dish on our first visit so that I could have it.  It's nice that some places want to go that extra mile.
I came in for lunch BC I heard the Won Ton soup here was good here. It was a cold Monday so this sounded good.
Kung Pao Seafood 2 - After ordering, the staff person shuffled back and asked "Kung Pao Seafood 2?"  We didn't know.  He ran (ALL the staff was *always* running around in a sort of panicked way) to grab a menu.  We identified our dish, indeed, as Kung Pao Seafood 2 ... but there was no K.P. Seafood 1!  Ours was the only one.  Odd.  The scallops were tasteless blobs of mushiness but I truly appreciated this dish's vegetable variety and that they were cooked just so.  The brown sauce was undistinguished.  
Did it hit the spot? Yes. Would I go back again? Only if I had a hangover.
My lunch experience stands at 2.5 stars. My introductory question for you: Cheap and Fast vs. Quality?
The service is friendly but does not talk fluent English. The food gets thrown to your table in less than 5 min after ordering: it was pre-cooked!
salt and pepper shrimp
Canton Dragon has been a family favorite for many years. They have an excellent selection of entrees to choose from, their lunch prices are fantastic, and the food portions are just right.
       - $8.95 Diced Beef with Black Pepper Sauce - One of my favorite Cantonese dishes. The beef was tender and the portion was generous.
I tried this place out based on the many reviews. I seemed to have gone on a bad day or maybe they had a new cook.  The man behind the counter was very nice and helped us pick out something from the menu while we made up our mind.  They have a lot of options which would allow for any combination of asian food one can imagine or be in the mood for.  I ordered the Spicy Szechuan with Tofu which seemed to have  out too quickly is my estimation.  The vegetables were hardly warmed up  and suspended in a huge amount of viscous pink sauce that had no spice at all.  It was so dense and cooled so quickly the veggies were floating in it like jello.  I can;t say I would recommend this place or that I'll be back anytime soon.
Go here.  Period.
Did I mention they deliver... for free?
Caveat -- I am a bit picky when it comes to Hong Kong style Chinese food
Also she was giggling when I asked her if she got a lot of complaints. I didn't check yelp before I placed my order, if I had this would all have been avoided.
The Honey chicken was completely disgusting. The only this you could taste was soy sauce and fish sauce to the point of over bitter. The wife never tried it because I could smell the level of fish sauce. 
- Sanitation: Clean 5 Star 
Iv never been to Hong Kong but it feels as though your actually in Hong Kong! Lol
I really felt for the Wong's to put so much into their business only to have the tremultous neighborhood love them so much and at the same time be the cause of much of their woes. Just as I was beginning to wonder off into oblivion - our order was up and it was gooooood!!
To start off, don't expect a fancy setting or anything. It's straight up, no frillz asian style cafe decor. It's in an excellent location as it is across from the Mekhong Plaza, however, it's kind of hidden inside this plaza so you would have to look hard for it.
Been here a few times and the food is always fresh and tasty.  I am Chinese from northern China.   This is authentic northern Chinese cuisine.  Food is not fancy but extremely delicious and satisfying.  Highly recommend the Zha Jiang noodles (meat sauce with hand made noodles), the chives and egg pocket, and dumplings.  Good prices and comforting home made Chinese food.  Owners are very nice.
One of the best, if not the best Chinese restaurant in the K-W area. The food is consistently good, the prices are fair and I have yet to order a menu item that disappointed me. The service is decent, they are good with getting orders right even when there are special requests due to dietary or allergy concerns, however they can be a bit slow, especially with deliveries taking up to 2 hours, but usually being a little over an hour. In fairness I do live a good 8 km away, which is a 15-20 minute drive on a good day. The restaurant itself sits tucked beside a grocery store and is easy to miss when driving by, the atmosphere and decor is nothing special but is comfortable enough to sit an enjoy some great food.
For the price i was expecting a bit more slices of brisket in my soup.
My lovely wife was craving Chinese food, so we decided to stop by for lunch.  Having researched it right her on Yelp, I knew not to expect this to be a place big on atmosphere and ambiance.  Walking in confirmed what I knew so far, but I think everyone needs to know - they weren't trying to achieve these things.  What this place does achieve is they make outstanding food.  There were 6 of us, and we all sampled different items from the menu.  I got the Mongolian beef with a side of Hot-n-Sour soup, while the wife got Szechuan beef and my daughters got Chow Mein and Orange Chicken with Egg Drop soup.  The soups came up first, and they were delicious. One of the many things my late father and I shared was an appreciation for good hot-n-sour soup, and he would have loved this.  Well done, with lots of mushrooms and tofu, and it was flavorful, while not being overdone with spice and pepper.  The egg drop was very flavorful, and was quickly gone.  The Mongolian Beef and Vegetables were tender and the dish was sauced well, not runny or dry.  My daughters loved the Orange Chicken, which was not overly sweet and carried plenty of spice.  My wife enjoyed her Szechuan beef, and concurred that it was flavorful and tender.  All of us had pork fried rice with our meal, and it was some of the best I have had.  Light, not greasy, and lots of flavor.  That seemed to be what stood out in everything - flavor.  None of the dished we tried lacked for flavor, and each was distinctly different.  I have been to many places and all of the food tasted so near to each other, it was barely noticeable.  The Iron Chef does not fall into that category. 
*Veggie Spring Rolls
First time, and last. Food was delivered quickly. Ordered Teriyaki Beef, Lemon Chicken and order of fried wantons. Teriyaki beef was small pieces of beef with good flavor but wierd slimy/greasy texture. Lemon chicken was literally fried scrap chicken (fatty and mixture of light & dark) fried and chopped then covered with bright yellow slime. Slime was lemonish tasting. Total disapointment. Wantons were tiny and way over cooked, meat in the center was as hard as the wanton. Since we ordered combos we got eggrolls too, mine smelled wierd and was pretty greasy. 
If you are in Caesar's, come here and watch the chefs make fresh noodles and check out the decor. It's a super unique finish. But then keep moving...Vegas has too many great options to bother with this spot.
They've lost a customer. Unfortunate because it took me a year to find adequate Chinese here in AZ. 
And I tried the Triple Alliance***
I believe that I tried some sort of spicy chicken dish, and my fiance had the House Special Chicken.  The food came relatively quickly.  It was hot, flavorful, and gave us enough for plenty to take home.  
I went here to order-to-go 30 minutes prior to closing time and I didn't want to be one of "those" customers who orders a lot right before closing.. but surprisingly, there were a lot of people ordering to-go so I didn't feel as bad!
Some time ago I ordered the pepper steak and onion, knowing full well that they were going to overload the dish with peppers in order to minimize the amount of meat they had to give me. This disregard for their customers should have been the first sign that I was making a big mistake eating here instead of just going down the street to Asian Kitchen or calling up Jade Garden for a delivery. At least as AK, they overload one order with more food than you could comprehend eating in two sittings.
Price: 
Well I've had it.  Three times in the recent past I ended up with food poisoning and came back for more. Sunday we ordered the General Chicken along with some Dim Sum items (which have gotten smaller every week and pricier).  It didn't look right.  Instead of a dark red sauce, it was very dark brown and burnt looking.  On the third bite it hit the back of my throat and I realized something was VERY wrong.  We sent it back.  No word from the kitchen at all.  We finally gave up and went to pay the bill.  I told Kwan the chicken was bad (owners daughter and front of house) - she just shrugged and said nothing which is her usual way of not dealing with things
We did takeout from here and both thought our dinners were awesome.  We ordered:
We have a couple of minor complaints though. The potstickers are made with a dough that's not rolled out thin enough for our taste. And the shrimp used in one of their dishes was not deveined which didn't go over very well when it was discovered, fortunately before anyone ate one. 
I suspect they ordered "off-menu", because the dishes were more authentic and traditional and my friend's parents did not need menus. Really, there were dishes that you would get at a great Chinese restaurant in Monterey Park or Irvine. Some stand out dishes:
1. Good value on lunch special
Went to Pearl for the 2nd time about a week before Christmas when I was in Vegas.  We loved it the first time a few years ago and loved it again this time.  The menu is mostly Cantonese and very authentic.  The only negative I can say about this place is that the price are quite high, but what do you expect on the strip.  Fortunately, the entree sizes are large enough for 4 people when eating family style.  On this visit we had a taro root clay pot, steamed chicken, baby bok choy, and a tofu dish.  All were excellent.  The service was top notch as you expect at a high end restaurant on the strip.

Sweet n sour pork
 You can taste the freshness in the food that you won't find at one of those stereotypical chinese fast food eateries. The portion sizes were generous too and a family meal is more than enough food for a family of 5, or perhaps even 6. That being said, the taste was only decent. The fried rice was flavorful and rich. The egg drop soup was as expected. The orange chicken is tasty and familiar, but brings nothing new to the table. The kung pao chicken had lots of crunchy vegetables but I have had better. The crab rangoons weren't good at all, but don't take my word for it because I've never liked those things. The spring rolls were ok but I've had better at random hole in the wall thai restaurants. The bottom line is that this place, while worthy of my future business, still cannot beat Pick up Stix in terms of quality and flavor. I hate to say it, but a corporation still has these guys beat.
Noodle Palace, along with Sushimon is a must eat when I'm in LV.  One word: Wonton.  They have the best wonton ever.  The wonton fillings consist of pork and shrimp.  The filling is packed with flavor and paired with the soup base it comes with fills your mouth with an explosion of deliciousness.  I tend to order the wonton mein because I love noodles and the noodles that come with the wonton is thin, has great texture and goes great with the wontons.  When I'm not feeling like a carb-head, I like to get a bowl of just wontons which come with 12 so perfect for one person or to share.  (i wish i had a pic to share but i ate it all before i remembered to take a picture :) )
The service is fast, but not friendly or helpful in describing or recommending their menu items.
I totally agree with Tom. This place was so bad we stopped eating and asked for our money back.
The Szechwan Beef Noodle Soup (Niu Lo Mein?...not sure of the spelling) was touted by one of my friends as possibly the best he's ever had outside of Taiwan (and apparently, one of the the spiciest based on the beads of sweat rolling down his head).  Three of the four of us ended up getting it based on how much he kept talking about the dish (my other friend ordered the Cantonese Beef Stew instead).  The broth was flavorful and it didn't seem too bad with the sodium level.  Certainly no worse than the average bowl of pho.  There were some good size chunks of meat to go with the noodles, so it certainly will help get you full.
However, the chicken was over-cooked, and the batter the chicken was fried in was soggy and mushy. There were no carrots or peas in the fried rice, which is a huge deal to me for some reason.
I am absolutely obsessed with this place. I ate here on my first trip to Vegas a few years ago and got hooked right away. I've been making this a vegas tradition ever since.
RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE.
It was the decor that draws us in and it was the food that truly amazes us. The decor itself is a piece of art. Inside of the restaurant resembles traditional Chinese courtyard style with Suzhou style windows and everything.   
I ordered the General Tso's Chicken ($9.95), Beef Chow Fun ($7.25), Eggplant in Garlic Sauce ($6.50), and Chicken Fried Rice ($6.50).  
This Panda Express is a bit hidden in the strip mall off of Hualapai and Charleston, but worth the find.  It's much better overall than the Panda Express up the street in the Red Rock Hotel & Casino food court.  Hidden gem for some Chinese-American take-out.
Service: 5 star 
They usually have way too much sauce, but it's not too bad otherwise.  If you're looking for a huge lunch for less that $4, it really can't get much better than this.  By far not the best, but it'll do in a pinch and the price can't be beat.
We stopped in while waiting for our service at Big O to be done. It's a great "hole in the wall" Chinese place! Prices are fair, and the sheer amount of good makes it a great value. Place was a clean, and staff friendly & attentive. Would have given it a 5 but the oil the fried portions were prepared in was old and it showed in the taste. The non-fried food was awesome.
My wife love it because of all of the gluten free options.  We get good service and the last time we were there, one of the managers, James I think, gave us a small side of soup for our daughter free.  Not that big of a deal but he could have easily said we needed to order a soup.  We will be back and hopefully James is working so I can thank him again.
Anyway, I figure since I was in the area taking care of errands, I will drive a few more blocks to try another new item on the HK Star lunch special menu. I have typically ordered the more expensive items, so decided I want to try something from the $4.95 portion of the menu.  Hong Kong Style Chow Fun sounds interesting, and I have never ordered it and would like to find out what exactly is HK Style Chow Fun.
If you don't mind presentation and aesthetics being sub-par and only care about the quality and quantity of food you are getting, it is hard to go wrong with these guys.
food was GREAT price  isnt too bad either
I will be honest...I was skeptical when I picked the place. The menu, appearance and feel of the place is pretty much like every other stripmall asian style fast food restaurant in town. The service however was not average. I was greeted quickly and with a smile and heartfelt "How are we doing tonight?"  She was able to answer all of my questions regarding the dishes I was considering and didn't even have to look at the menu for help.
Thinking that general tso chicken and crab ragoons were the safe choices for ANY chinese take out, I was wrong. 
- Bonus: Upon paying my dinner/bar tab I received a "$50 Hakkasan Gift Voucher...Thank you for dining with us during Las Vegas Restaurant Week."  I was flabbergasted that the meal was only $50.14 and I got a $50 "gift voucher valid until April 10, 2014."  I almost felt guilty accepting it.  When my buddy is in town early Apr, will definitely bring him here.
Pork Shaomai - The pan-fried dumplings stuffed with pork, veggies, ginger, and scallions were delicious. I regret not eating more.
they very friendly ,nice, helpfull , room clean, the restroom clean too,
May be chief was in the wrong mood!?!
This place reminds of Wong's Palace in Tempe but not as good.  For some reason, the food just doesn't hit the spot.  The chicken chow fun was tasteless and was just flat out goopy.  All of the noodles just stuck to each other.
We split Shanghai Dumplings $6.25 for 8. These are Wendy's xiao long bao or soup dumplings. The wrapper was a bit thicker than I prefer and the juice inside somewhat sparse. The flavor was fine. 
I think they're gone now.  Called twice in the past two weeks to order take out, and get a recording saying the line's been disconnected.  Not happy!
I wouldn't drive all the way across town for it, but I'm happy they are so close to my house... finally a much better option than Panda!
Dude, there was a turtle in the fish tank that I saw as I left.  I hope they don't eat that!
They also do a takeaway menu which is a hit with the locals and they seem to have good banter with the staff.  Their prices are what you'd expect and I paid about £10 for my meal which was pretty reasonable.  I'd come here again just for that specials board.
Service was quick and on top of things, even with the Memorial Day crowd. So if you're wanting a buffet, but looking for a smaller, less crowded breakfast buffet, head over to NY NY and check out Chin Chin.
I'm not hating on this place because it's "Americanized," I couldn't care less if it's not what people in Beijing eat.  All I care about is it TASTING GOOD.  Bleh.
Food was okay. The place was empty. I felt bad because I hate seeing local places struggle!
Roasted flank steak was ok........ Served with fried spinach. That was nice. Here is another rant.... We were offered a choce in the tasting menu with our entrees. Fried rice or wasabi mashed potatoes. We were never asked and of course got wasabi mashed potatoes. We asked for the side to be changed, it was and we were billed for it!!!!! nice!!!!
I like this place. The staff is very nice and helpfull. The food is good and a decent price. The portions are large and I always have leftovers. I usually stop in every week or two. I like the lemon chicken and everything else. I've tried a bit of most of the menu.
Good food. Friendly service. Reasonable price.  We stopped here because the shopping complex looked very appealing - makes you feel like you are really entering China town (a less people around though!!)! We had the szechwan chicken & chicken fried rice & szechwan pork... all dishes were good, tasty not bland and definitely filling. Sunday afternoon was fairly quiet so we didn't have to wait long to be served our food.  We will visit again to try another dish.
- shrimp balls ($5.95)
I want to love this place...I even tell people they should totally eat here. Then why would I only rate it "A-OK"?
Service was excellent and timely, place was very clean, located far south east but I hear there's actually people that live out there these days so that's cool.
Lunch specials were good. Pretty standard stuff. Egg soup was a bit boring, but I'm not a fan of egg soup. Crab puff and eggroll and fried rice were the sides and all were good. Main courses were large enough that we both had more than we could finish.
I will recommend it to any one looking for affordable take out
-thick wonton wrappers - I don't like having to chew through thick wonton skin especially in my soups
This is the first place we hit to have our lunch as soon as we arrived at Vegas. Decent chinese food. Ma pao tofu was a little too soft and not much spicy.
I live in North Phoenix near Desert Ridge and I often go down to Mesa to eat at Best Hong Kong on Southern and Dobson.  Now, I hardly go there not because I don't like the food but because I can get another dish with the gas money I save by going to King Wah! 
We've seen this place every time we've come to LV but usually, on our way back to the hotel AFTER we've had our meal. I really wanted to try it because I've seen the Chinese writing as we've whizzed by and it says they have things like jook, wonton noodle soup and much more.
It's a breath of fresh air to have food that tastes more like what, literally, mom used to make at home. The meat pies, dumplings, noodles, and soups are all pretty great. They have some dishes like spicy chicken but you don't really grab a big bowl of rice with chicken and beef with northern Chinese cuisine.
This place is great. I'm Chinese and I'm very picky about my food. When I want take out, I come here. Granted, I cheat a little because I order things that are not on the menu sometimes but I've never been unhappy eating in or taking out. I even brought my parents and they liked it. It's close and authentic. The staff is friendly, the food is consistent.  It is lacking in atmosphere but I'll give that up for consistently good food.  If you order sweet and sour pork, orange chicken, or similarly Americanized dishes, read a different review. I've never ordered those kinds of dishes here so I can't speak for them.
Ok, not sure how this place ended up with 2 Yelp pages, but since I reviewed the other one the last time I came here, I'll do this one for my more recent visit.
We ordered the chicken with black bean sauce and beef with broccoli. They were both fantastic, but the won ton soup was delightful.  Food was tasty and not too salty. Delivery time was a little longer than promised and customer service left something to be desired, but overall a good choice for local chinese delivery.
I took my daughter there for lunch, it was 12pm on a Thursday, and it wasn't packed, we placed our order, I had the orange chicken combo, extra spicy! Omg so delish!! I love their spicy orange chicken! Cannot get enough!
In terms of food... bleh. I had the broccoli and beef with spring rolls on the side. I can safely say I've had $5.99 Chinese takeout meals that have been way better. The food really had no flavor to it, and I had to douse it with duck sauce and other spices to coax any sort of taste out of the dish. 
Shrimp and pork fried dumplings - ehhhhh kinda dull 
Great noodles and wonton noodle soup.
I have sampled many spicy dishes, from the Yui Shan to the Curry, and all were great.
After reading a great review in the New Times, I decided to take my parents (visiting from Chicago) to this restaurant. Living in the Second City, they know good Chinese food. We frequent the dive restaurants along Wentworth Ave whenever I fly into town. 
The BBQ counter is typical chinese BBQ - BBQ pork, roast duck, and - well, not much else (at least I haven't seen much else selection-wise whenever I've visited).  Flavors are pretty much on point - but nothing special.  If this is what you're after and you're in this neighborhood, you might as well get it here; otherwise it's a trip out to Chandler or Glendale - or make it at home.
Nice Chinese take-out place for students.
Food was below average and staff a little rude !
My hubby ordered the water boiled fish which got rave reviews in the New Times article and by other Yelpers.   But as others have said,  the wait staff has a bit of a problem with English and so it took a bit to find out the kind of fish it was.  According to the cook, it was sole.  When it arrived it was in a bowl with broth and swimming in a red oil.  So we began to scoop out the oily top and finally decided it was easier to move the fish and the veggies to a plate and eat it from there.  The fish was delicately cook and the veggies had some flavor but nothing to write home about.  He ate it but I didn't hear the usual oo's and ah's when he really likes something.  He ate it in silence which usually means, I ordered it so I have to eat it.  He ordered it at my suggestion since some people seems to enjoy it in the newspaper review but I guess all palates are not the same.  Next time I'll keep my "gills" shut.  
We walked in to the restaurant and I was surprised at how nice it looked inside! I've been to several Chinese restaurants where inside has pink wall paper, and an assortment of Chinese-type figures all over, and out-dated look, with a huge fish tank in the "wait-to-be-seated" area. No, this one was pretty snazzy! Another plus. 
After a quick survey of the simple menu, I ordered the appetizer Pork Wonton in Red Chili Sauce, Sliced Pork & Mushrooms with Hand-Pulled Noodles and finally added the Beijing Noodle Soup with Hand-pulled Noodles (although I had placed the order to use the Hand-Cut Noodles for comparison).
The eat-in portion of the place has three booths and a small two person table.  The total diners that could eat in at the same time would be about 14 - and it would be a cramped fit.
Wow. I am blown away by some of the positive reviews here. I have eaten a lot of Chinese food in my life and the difference between the best and the worst has always been fairly close. Its all generally pretty good. I went to the Golden Harvest 2 weeks ago, while trying to tour local establishments as a new resident. For the first time, I actually had BAD Chinese food. First, my daughter is a big fan of Orange Chicken and the childs menu only had a couple of choices, orange chicken is not one of them. Asked if we could have a childs portion and the waiter (owner?) said no. That's a problem because the adult portion is huge. We should have just left right then and there. Second problem, Sweet & Sour Chicken was terrible. Sauce was terribly watered down and tasteless,  which made the chicken soggy after only 5 mins. Rice was edible, but below par. My father had the beef and broccoli and could only manage about half. I've never seen this guy not finish...he said it was gross. I am a big supporter of local places, but unfortunately I wont be able to come back to the not so golden palace.
Anyways, I ordered the Mu Shu Vegetable and the Mixed Vegetable with Shrimp in the "Health Food Section" of the menu.  I probably would not describe either dish as "yummy yummy," but they were satisfactory. The portions were large and the vegetables were fresh, but the garlic sauce that came with the shrimp dish was pretty nasty.  
I decided I would call to fix the issue, I knew it was a mistake and that there was obviously some sort of miscommunication. I call and speak to a girl (I was not sure if this was the same girl that took my order). I told her what happened and she told me that she took my order and that I never told her that I was a vegetarian. I then stated that I have been a vegetarian for over 10 years and I am fully aware of how to order vegetarian food. I tried to deescalate the situation because it seemed as though the girl was getting defensive and it was a simple mistake. I told her all that I wanted was a refund for the one dish and she said they would only give me credit.
This is the worst Chinese food you will ever eat. Then, you'll get to taste it again as it comes back up. I had the worst bout with food poisoning of my entire life after eating here. Perhaps it was just their almond chicken, but I won't be going back to eat any of their other dishes ever again. I warn everyone I can about this place when it comes up in conversation. If you want good Chinese, drive a little bit further southwest to Big Heng on 75th and Peoria. Far superior food for less money, and you won't throw it up.
Definitely recommended!!!
Parking? Who needs parking when there's valet? 
Still, I rate Panda Express 2/5 stars because I still love their food. I can't find Beijing Beef anywhere else and that's my favorite. Also, their "Chow Mein" - by the way, guys, that's more like LO MEIN, but still - is good as is their Orange Chicken (though I've had much better at a Chinese Buffet.) Unfortunately, you'll have to pay an extra dollar for shrimp items, and take my word for it: it's not worth it. I'd barely order them at the same price.
Try the red chile sauce at your table.  It is such a good burn.
And .... 
The prices were understandable since it was inside the Venetian (GORGEOUS hotel by the way) so we were fine with that.
I've been to this restaurant few times when I visit my friend in south mountain.
I have also had the pot stickers here. Apparently steamed and then grilled to put some heavenly char-flavoring on them.  (a little expensive at $7.95 plus tax, but oh so good.)
im not exaggerating, we saw about 10 different cars like this while eating our china chef. 
I would LOVE to tell you that the shrimp with lobster sauce is out of this world! I would enjoy waxing poetic about the jumbo size of Wahsun's eggroll's! It would please me to no end to tell you about how sweet Rose is!
Overall, try this place at your own risk, but you have been forewarned and have a high chance of walking out disappointed.
After reading all the reviews on Yelp for this place, I decided to give it a try, and I'm SO glad I did. This place is fabulous. And their prices are very reasonable, especially for their lunch specials!
This place is great! I had a take out order of Kung Pao Chicken Chinese style extra hot. They were able to crank it out in about 5 minutes!  They gave large portions that made for easily two meals, I would definitely recommend at least giving it a shot.
Upon walking in I was greeted by about 3 of their staff all smiling at me, looking eager to have something to do... that made me feel a little weird.  Could business be that slow and were they desperate for my business?  It was mother's day so it could have been unusually slow and this location just opened not too long ago too.  Anyways I was committed to trying their sushi because the craving was strong.
They have great combo specials served all day for $6.95. Not a bad deal at all! This is a great spot for lunch and dinner at bargain prices. You can also choose your entree size: small (under $6) or large (under $10). They offer generous portions, so we would try small next time. 
So ever since this place has opened, my family has migrated here from KJ Kitchen. We've gone here for b-days, graduations, christmas, new year, you name it, we did it here.  Honestly, the food is pretty much the same.. still tasty and done Hong Kong style. The main reason we migrated was because KJ was just getting too popular and crowded and service was just getting poor. Since there's a competing restaurant now, I guess the customers are getting spread. The service here is definitely better and they run super super cheap tasty lunch specials. 
Not the best Chinese restuarant on the Strip.  Food was okay tasting and overpriced.  Presentation is good and decor is nice.  Nice looking atomsphiere for dinner but food is better at other places and priced better.
Some people have said that this place serves the best Chinese food in the Valley.  Others say it sucks.  I have an opinion between the two extremes.
#3 -  I can call in an order, hop in my car to pick it up, and be back watching quality reality programming within 15 minutes
After getting over the whole situation, we went ahead and ordered two lunch specials: Mongolian Beef ($9.95) and Orange Chicken ($9.95). Both came w/ soup, rice, and a Spring roll. On top of that we also ordered Salt & Pepper Calamari ($8.25) and Steamed Pork Siu Mei ($3.50). The Calamari was very different. It didn't come with any sauces and it came on a bed of lettuce with onions and jalapenos on top. We both really enjoyed it. Rather than relying on the sauce for the flavor, the dry toppings gave it all the flavor it needed and the jalapenos were a nice little kick. The Orange Chicken was alright, nicely breaded and cooked. The Mongolian Beef, however, was WAY TOO SAUCY. This pic I took: http://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/deeOpEHwPHQpXvF7YYPIcA/l.jpg doesn't even detail the amount of sauce that was on it because the lighting was poor. It was like someone was having a water balloon fight in the kitchen, except with water balloons filled with sauce and one of them accidentally landed and exploded on top of my Mongolian Beef. I just stuck to everything else on my plate and picking off Don's plate. 
Tuki gives the SS chicken 4 tails!
In reality I should probably give this place four-stars but there are some intangibles that give this restaurant the boost into five-star country for me.
We started off with some Hot and Sour Soup and followed with Salt and Pepper Shrimp, Hong Kong Style Pan Fried Noodles, Beef Chow Fun, and Pork Spareribs.
I've never had anything but the chicken and broccoli from here. My husband and I love it so much, we dont care to try anything else! It's very small and only a few tables but we always order take out anyway and our orders always ready for pick up within 20 minutes max.
This place is terrible! 
"Great variety of dim-sum, very crowded Chinese restaurant and good price! 3/5
DO NOT WAIST YOUR MONEY! The food is not very good but the customer service is awful. I picked up dinner for my family. When I got home I realized that half the order was the wrong order. When I called Dragon Wok the person that answered said bring it back and we will give you the right items. She also told me that I would owe $1.08 that is the difference in price for the correct food. I asked her to deliver the food. She said they would have to wait until the rain stopped and delivery would cost $3. I couldn't believe they wanted to charge me $3 for delivery when this was her mistake. I told her to take the $5 tip I gave her to offset the $3 plus the $1.08. She told me if I want the correct order I would have to pick it up and pay the difference - then she hung up on me. I called back and asked for the manager and was told the manager was not in. We ended up throwing the food away. Even the steamed rice was not good.
I've been ordering from this place for a couple months and have always loved the food however the customer service is severely lacking. After tonight I will no longer be ordering from this restaurant. The person taking my order could not get it right, the delivery took a half hour longer than expected, our order was incorrect when we got it and when we called them to tell them what was missing and wrong they said they weren't sure if someone could bring the missing/incorrect items. They will not refund anything but they will give a credit which does nothing since I will not order from them again.
We found the employees freely serving the item we were waiting for .... And defending the fact that they basically forgot our order. Terrible service ... Drive to a panda somewhere else ... Just not this one.
I got a menu at my front door an asked my self why not try something new besides panda express, i went inside it was pretty quiet, i ordered a few things for me an my family. I think it was the mongolian beef, shrimp fried rice and some other dishes. The food was AMAZING, much better than panda express or any rich garden an chop chop that leaves there food sitting in the heater all day. Tasty cooks all of there food fresh and it tastes alot better than food that are left on display. Overall this place was 
Steel Cut Irish Oatmeal and Stone Ground Grits
I wondered whether the dish was good because of the memories or because it was just, legitimately, good. So a few weeks later I asked if my parents would let me treat them to Chinese. Bo Bo Chicken, Yu Shuan Chicken & House Special were ordered. The Bo Bo was tasty. I wish it were spicier (as purported) but understand that not everyone has a Chicano mouth like mine. It kind of reminded me of Ramen noodles, the instant kind. I love Ramen. The Yu Shuan was good too. Meat was dark so it was juicy and flavorful but was also supposed to be spicy and was not. House Special was great, again. 
We stop at Flo's about every other week and have never been disappointed. Service is always prompt especially when we have Pablo as our server. The happy hour specials are a real bargain and there is a wide variety of appetizers to chose from. 
Important caveat: this review pertains to dim sum on Saturday and Sunday ONLY!  Monday through Friday, it is a pale shadow of its weekend self, although ordering from the menu might be just fine.  Note too that dim sum is served, or rather trundled by on carts, from 11am to 2pm only.  I'd suggest arriving around 11:30am or noon.  Although it will be crowded, there will be the most variety of dim sum choices.  
I ordered the chicken szechwuan, the waitress warned me it was "spicy" the reason I ordered it.  It came out delicious, but not what I would call spicy.  Overall its hard to find good Chinese in the valley and I would call this good without hesitation.
the food was dirt cheap- we got two eggrolls, chicken fried rice, spicy chicken dinner, and 12 wontons and diet coke. we spent a total of $16.
Service was ok. steamed rice was very dry. Mongolian beef had a good taste.  Mushu chicken was very bland and had to ask for plum sauce to be able to eat it. 
 That being said I suspect they cook on the idea of being more health conscious on a lot of dishes so for many people that could mean bland. And the dishes that are greasy, Hong Kong noodles, lemon chicken ..are just that greasy.  
2. When our waitress finally came to our table the first thing she did was start removing silverware and placemats. I found this to be rude and slightly gross - I don't want silverware on my table that other people could've touched. 
Hubby got general tsos chicken, he was very satisfied,  heat was just right and the pork fried rice was very tasty.
Defintiely get it to go, the place is pretty small and I'd imagine eating inside would just be plain awkward.
But isn't no M.S.G, high quality veggies and meats, pure veggie oil only, well trimmed meats and poultry to keep the fat content low, and the general care and expertise in preparation worth the wait?  
They bring out a sample platter of a few different foods/raw meat and let you season everything to your liking and then heat it all over top of an open flame. It was nice being your own chef in an actual Asian Restaurant. 
Does this menu sound familiar?
We ordered lemon chicken, an orange sauced shrimp dish (can't remember the name and their website is under construction so I couldn't check), a beef stir fry with veggies, panfried dumplings and Yang Chow fried rice (not 100% sure of the name).  Everything was so, so good.  The lemon chicken was so crispy and perfectly cooked and the shrimp dish was absolutely delicious and a very ample portion.  The dumplings were crispy and flavorful and the fried rice dish was something that I couldn't wait to delve into because it looked so good and different from most I've had at other restaurants.  They didn't stir fry it in soy sauce but instead left it alone and simply combined it with plenty of shrimp and veggies so it was still white and not oily at all.   There were two of us so we ordered too much food but the leftovers fed us again no problem.  We wanted variety - what can I say?!
For example, try the house Flamingo chicken.  It is so good.  We wiped out their szechuan chicken, it was spicy and fantastic.  I also highly recommend their pu pu platter and spicy shrimp.  Yum!
All of the dishes lacked flavor. Tried to make it more palatable with hot chili oil, but that was bland too. WTH?! 
The service is great too! The majority of workers have simple English, however they are fast to serve you. They are super friendly and smile. They do their best to serve you. 
The search begins anew.
We were very pleased with our Twice cooked beef, Shrimp Chow Suey, and Deep Fried (battered) Shrimp.  We ordered a side of white rice to eat with the Twice cooked beef.  The Twice cooked beef was my favorite!.
Better than Panda Express.  Will only eat here if I have too.
Average :
They do charge for tea. Don't be expecting tea to be free just because it's an Asian place. $3 for a pot of flavorless Jasmine Green Tea. My opinion is that I can get better tea for $1. I might as well be Asian and order hot water.
I Love This Place!!
Overall, i would NEVER go back again. and if anyone still wants to go please ask for the "white people menu" because it is a lot cheaper and surprisingly the same portion with more choices to pick from.
Sensory overload aside, Dragon Way isnt a great Chinese restaurant - dont get me wrong, it has all the right ingredients on paper to be a good place to go. Good food, nice staff, competative price - but something is missing. Its an authentic feeling of China, rather than a blinged up Scottish take away. Its one of those things that you wouldnt miss until it was taken away from you - Dragon Way really suffers from a lack of atmosphere.
Rather than fight for a bite of food, all you have to do here is wait to be seated and order from the menu. We were lucky and nabbed two chairs right in front of the cook's station, which provided the perfect vantage point for foodie voyeurism. We watched the chef and his crew make noodles and dumplings by hand. One might think that a menu this basic takes very little time to prepare, but it's all about the details and handiwork. 
So, we'll be back, Mr. Tott's...we'll be back.
The specialty rolls - A disaster.  Seriously?  Breaded shrimp for tempura, breaded and deep fried unagi (consistency of cold, fatty, chicken skin), rolls half stuffed with cream cheese, and imitation crab when the menu say real crab (hard to take when the roll is $17).  Finally, just because you were featured on a show about spicy food does not mean that a killer hot sauce should be drizzled on everything.  Ack!
i had a  seafood rice noodle 米线 here and open at 2am in the morning and eating it with the cashed out earnings from black jack, nothing could of been a sweeter experience. Im so grateful that such a tasty place is open so late at night till 4am i believe. I was so enamored with the place we decided to come back again for brunch the next day. Equally tasty sober or buzzed!  really after a night of fun and looking for something comforting for the tummy this really is the place to come to!  next time i stop in vegas again i'll be sure to swing on by back at anytime.
The food's a far cry from anything remotely Asian and I include Panda Express and fast food Chinese chains into this equation.  I should've known better by the food displays, but I didn't think what I was ordering was on display.
Overpriced. Why mince words? I've visited China A Go Go enough times to hold Yelp's Duke status at the time I'm writing this. And tonight when I walked out the door and looked at my container of Kung Pao Chicken then back at my receipt I realized I'd just got shanghaied. I paid Lotus of Siam prices for suburban, Boulder Highway strip mall Chinese food. 
The lunch special menu is valid daily from 11 am to 4:30 pm and again from 9:30 pm to 12 am. You may have to request for this specific menu though.
Another prime example as to how bad service can taint a good food experience. If the service were better, Red House could have earned a 3/4 stars from me. 
I was in the area and decided to grab a quick lunch!  Let me tell you, the food is yummy!  It's tasty like a nicer Chinese place with the price of a fast food joint.  I got crispy noodles with dipping sauce, egg drop soup, fried rice, lo mein, and sauteed veggies (all included in the lunch special) for just under 6 bucks!  Highly recommended for a nice bite in the Green Valley area.
Overall, I was very happy with Karen's Unicorn and would go there again.
We also decided to try the duck and Im glad we did. It was delicious! Not dry at all , not too greasy ..just right. We also added the crab and lobster cakes.. Guys if you go there, order those FOR SURE. What an experience on the flavor!
My favorite Chinese spot in town!!! Legit and very tasty Asian Cuisine is surved here every night. When I want real Chinese, not Panda, this is where I end up. I highly recommend it!
first the basics, the portion was over priced and small
I have been to Ichiban more than 10 times since it first opened ~ 2 years ago. When I first heard of their name, I thought it's a Japanese restaurant. But make no mistake, Ichiban serves up authentic Sze Chuan food. Their menu and taste are actually pretty similar to Fugu, but since Ichiban opened I frequent Ichiban so much more because parking is so much easier right in front of the restaurant itself or along one of the streets nearby (free in the evenings and weekends!). 
I asked for sweet fire chicken received surf & turf.
Fresh food, made to order in no time flat!
The food is great (except sometimes its hit and miss). We always order the soybean milk, chinese fried donut (don't know what they are called), pork sung, fried donut wrapped in sticky rice, scallion pancake and sometimes my mom order others items but those are the basic we always get.
I have eaten at all the fantastic food Vegas has to offer, love the steaks at Cut and Mastro's, dinner at Mario Battali's but no matter what I eat my favorite is always Noodles Asia!  I will get off the plane and want to come here for my Siu Mai and Szechuan Beef noodle soup.  I can't find anything close to it and I won't even bother to try and make it.  But the yummy chilis, tasty soup broth and those chewy noodles always leaving me wanting more...Vegas is not a trip without visiting Noodles Asia!
I'd definitely come back again for the atmosphere.  I'll probably order different items to see if I can find something that I like better on the menu.
I'll go back to check out other dishes.
  At the end I think this place is ok. You get what you pay for and is a good alternative for when you're broke or want to take a date that you don't really want to see again.
Fin was good, not the best Chinese I've had but as far as the overall dining experience it was very good.  The place looked good nice date place or a big party.  The service was excellent.  It's advertised as fine dining so yes it lives up to that in both decor and service.  As far as food it was just A-OK.  But then again it's not as expensive as other "Fine dining " Vegas restaurants.
Dim sum and the Singapore Style Noodles are what I would recommend, but all of their dishes are quite delectable.  The first time I tried Chin Chin, I was with a group of 12 during the Thanksgiving holiday weekend.  We ordered about 20 dishes between the 12 of us- food came quickly and HOT, and the quality of the food was great.  Have a craving for chinese food while in Vegas?  I would recommend this establishment.
Not a restaurant I would ever eat in because of the lack of atmosphere. They do have a plant in the front window but other than that, pretty plain.
All in all, an average meal.
 name a few.  Now if that hasn't teased your taste buds...you can not go wrong with the duck bao burgers.  
Price - 2/5
2. I was starving I only had 6 bucks and this was the closet place...
I have not been eating here when I have easy access to it. I remember when I finally went in there this past Saturday, that I had stopped by this place when I first moved to Arizona and really wanted a smoothie-but I think all their smoothies had dairy so I just left. A really nice warm environment-still totally a quick lunch place, but I still felt comfortable coming here at night-and judging from the full tables of ASU hipsters feeding each other tofu on dates, so did they.
If you're there say... on a Friday night at about 7PM, forgetaboutit.
I have mixed feeling about their service, on one end, we got an odd waitress with rude attitude and she took forever to get the bill right at the end.  On the other end, we have great supporting service with our plates getting swap for clean one after each dinner phase and there was a floor manager figure making service was up to par.  They all still had that poker face though.
I tried both the red curry and the yellow curry.  The flavors were good, but the value was not there compared to other establishments.  I would  come back if I was in the area, but would not seek it out.
Again, don't go here for a gourmet experience, but for a cheap Americanized-Chinese food experience.
The best in Vegas by far. All dishes are homemade.
For $7.30 not including a drink you get a noodle bowl.  You also get to get in on their asian-style fried chicken wings, egg rolls, soups, jello, and fried biscuits with sugar.
Very simple standard for basic Chinese. If the Veggie Rice does not contain frozen peas and carrots, then we are in business. This place came through, so its off to a good start. Onions, broccoli and chopped mushrooms were found in this pint of rice at about 5 bucks. Might not try anything else, but go for the rice if you get a chance. Don't think this is true NY Chinese though because I did not see Cold Sesame Noodles in play and that is a key appetizer in all NY joints. Lunch specials at $5.99 might be worthy at some point.
Decor/atmosphere - 5 stars
Yes, the meal was more expensive than what I'm used to spending for a bowl of noodles, but hey, we were in Vegas at the Wynn....and it was tasty!  It's more important that I enjoy what I eat.   I'd be silly to think that it would actually be cheap at the Wynn versus a hole in the wall in Monterey Park. I'd definitely go back.
Flavorful broth. Check. 
First of all, I was surprised at how large the space is, and you would never know from the outside what a lovely patio they have. The perfect evening weather made it a no-brainer to sit outside. It faces a little water feature, walkway bridge and lots of foliage. Except for the noise from Jalapeno's across the way, I felt like I was in another world.  Tables are spaced well so you don't feel like you are on top of any other diners.
I love this location. I used to go here at least once a week until I moved across town. Awesome lunch specials, fantastic staff and great food fast. Vegetarian pad thai is my fave, but the house chicken is to die for and the Mongolian beef is good too. :D 
This is one of the best Chinese restaurants in the south part of the valley - There is a reason why this place has been voted the best of Las Vegas by the RJ for a few years. The service is great and the food is the best I have had in sometime ! Take out? Dine In? Take your pick - they make you feel at home either way!
I tried this place out all because of Shane's ROTD and yep it lived up to its greatness. I ordered a appetizer platter, twice cooked pork and pork fried rice. (Apparently I was craving pork which is beyond rare) Man all of the food was really good. The egg rolls were stuffed with yummy goodness, the honey chicken was finger-licking good, there was TONS of pork fried rice packed into that container. My goodness was it stuffed. The only disappointment was the twice cooked pork. Don't get me wrong it was good, but when I ask for extra, extra spicy, that is exactly what I am expecting and it fell short. :(  But will it stop me from going back,? heck no. I am already thinking about what I will be ordering this coming weekend.
I've been trying out all of the chinese restaurants in the area and I think I've found my new favorite.  Its right next to Church's chicken and I only found out of it because of the tiny sign out by the road.
Tott's is not a place you would go out of your way to frequent if you didn't like or work in the area. If you do, however, live or work in the area, I would highly recommend checking it for a fast and decent Asian lunch or dinner. And, yes, I use the word Asian, not Chinese - even though the dishes on the menu are primarily Chinese (although even that word is used loosely), the owners' inclusion of select Thai and Japanese dishes makes the cuisine more Asian than Chinese. Sort of like the food at Pei Wei, which just happens to be in the same center, but cheaper, more flavorful, and served with a little more heart. 
The space is on the second floor of the strip mall in Chinatown. The ambiance is your typical Chinese place. Not dirty, not immaculate, Asian style decor, well lit, small and large tables. 
Today, I was rushing from one place to another and needed some fast food.  Not feeling like a burger, I thought that Panda Express sounded convenient.  I was not disappointed though at the same time, the meal was not a gourmet one either.  There was only one person working the register while at the same time serving food so there was a bit of a wait (and the staff member was a bit flustered with much going on at once).  I am guessing that another staff member was on a break as there was a second person there by the time I left.  The restaurant was also kept quite clean though it appeared that the forks and napkins needed some restocking.  
I could eat the Mu Shu Pork every day and be a happy camper. This dish gets better every time! The portion is large and the service is great. My to go order is always ready in a few minutes.  Not gonna happen at most places!  
Go to KJ Kitchen if you are looking for great tasting chinese food in the Vegas area.  
As I have stated in previous reviews, I do enjoy Chinese food but it is not a do or die with me as it is for my husband. After reading the rave yelps I decided to take my husband here for one main thing...the salt and pepper cod. Ok...I was enamored with the salt and pepper pork. :)
I'm a Chinese girl. I love the beef noodle soup there! Compare with noodle house at  Venetian casino, wasabi Jane's noodle soup taste very good! And also the price is pretty good for guests! I saw there are Chinese travelers going to this place all the time, their common review said beef noodle soup taste best and fresh! Btw, someone complain the water they charge 10 cents, in my way, I'm very understanding!!! Cuz the price of everything going up now in the world, everywhere charge more for water, no more free! If u can afford to $2 bottle of water on the strip,why did u complain they charge u 10 cents for water also can free refill ,right? We come the restaurant for eating the good food! If u mind the 10 cents water, my suggestion is that u can bring ur own water come  to restaurant  for eating!!!
Culturally if you disapprove of the food you don't outright complain as it is seen as extremely shameful and rude! If you disapprove then don't eat the food and leave. A full plate left is also insulting but a more acceptable way to show your dissatisfaction. If you don't care about cultural customs then just be a typical un cultured person and whine. 
It's a small Chinese Restaurant next to Bashas. I was out with some friends and we found a small restaurant. We ordered Walnut shrimp and egg foo young. The food was pretty good for its price and the staff was friendly. They even gave us free crab puffs. 
Best salted pepper chicken hands down! It's hard to find a place that has salted pepper chicken on the menu in AZ. This is it! I love love love the cripsy chicken and it goes perfect with fried rice or chow mein. Swtich it up once in a while and get Orange chicken, but salted pepper is my favorite here! DELISH!
We're picky about egg rolls and like the big thick ones we're used to from back east.  These were significantly smaller, but were good enough,  not greasy and not soggy inside.  The rice is outstanding.  The house special was loaded with beef, chicken and shrimp and flavorful.  Not your typical bland variety that needs soy sauce or whatever to flavor it up.  The shrimp fried rice had decent sized shrimp in it and the shrimp itself was outstanding, omg could have had a plateful of just the shrimp.  The shrimp tasted fresh and flavorful, and not rubbery.  
Love the food, the help is very nice, I had the wonton noodles and the ribeye buns...they both fantastic and I can't wait to try more dishes!
The waitress currently working there is super friendly and remembers me every time I go. I generally eat to-go just because I usually stop by quite late.
I paid $18 for beef chow fun and my buddy paid $13 for veggie chow mein. Besides being overpriced, the food was good and the service was consistent. If you want "real" Chinese food in Vegas, take a cab off the strip.
I keep coming back for the schezwan noodle soup (niu ro mein). The soup is so wonderfully rich and complex with just a hint of spiceness. It's so deliciously satisfying and soothing! The noodles have just the right amount of bite. I wish the meat was just a little bit more tender, but still very good nonetheless. 
I had dinner here at a recommendation from a local person I spoke to at a department store. This is my dinner and feed back:
This is as close to New York Chinese food that it gets. Their salt and pepper calamari is amazing not over cooked or over breaded. The imperial seafood meal is to die for, it has a great combination of seafood and fresh vegetables cooked to perfection. They have a great selection of dishes and some very inexpensive lunch specials compared to the size of the meal. The house special fried rice as my son says has a little something for everyone in it! Don't forget to take home the spicy mustard it is the best! You can sit down and eat but it has more of a fast food atmosphere. We enjoy taking our bounty of food to go!
Worst service ever! Went here a few weeks ago about an hour and a halfway before they closed and got treated horribly ! I asked if we could get an appetizer and our writer replies with "we'll what do you want? The kitchens closing soon" we got up and left right then. Also had a hair in my water. Never coming here again !!
The lunches each came with choice of soup (I chose hot & sour), an egg roll and a cream cheese deep fried wonton. My entree was Hunan beef. My wife had almond chicken and my friends had Teriyaki chicken and Mongolian beef. Now, except for the Teriyaki chicken, I would not expect soy sauce in the dishes. But it was in every dish. Weird. My wife's almond chicken had corn and peas in it for filler vegetables. No, I'm not talking snow peas and baby corn. I'm talking about corn and peas you would get from your freezer or a can. Weird. Oh, yeah, AND zucchini. I had baby corn and snow peas but also celery. I'm always leery of Chinese dishes that have celery in it. That reads: cheap filler. My wife's and my dishes did have water chestnuts in it.
I now go there once a week or so to enjoy the savory lunch.
We had to pop our heads out to get our servers attention since we probably only saw him twice.
I heard about this place from a friend of mine and decided to check it out. I really liked their Noodles and the chicken dishes. The soup was good too and so was the sushi. The service was really prompt and we were lucky to not have to wait for our table. Overall, a good experience.
ordered the egg drop soup, eggplant and tofu, and ginger beef with green onion.  egg drop soup was unspectacular, not good and not bad... fortunately, the other 2 dishes were quite good, the eggplant was fresh and combined with the flavorful tofu, the dish was amazing.  next up was the ginger beef dish, i would have eaten it all had the portions been smaller, but that was definitely a plus.  big portions, simply said!!!
A couple of weeks ago, I saw a "Shangri-La" sign go up at the new location a few blocks from my home at 59th and Union Hills, and figured it was a long shot that it was related to the place I knew and loved.  But last week I walked in and instantly recognized the hostess who was at the old location for at least 20 years.  We had a brief chat and she explained that the owners of the old location sold the business to another family and have opened this new location. 
Dude and his roommate used to live nearby, and this was one of their college staples. How I never went here before this year, the world will never know. 
I had a "lunch" special with soup (hot and sour) egg roll, crab puff, fried rice and the main dish. The soup was really good, it had a little kick to it too. The crab puff was the first thing I ate. It was great. The egg roll was standard fare egg roll, nothing stood out and was the only part of the meal I could go without. The rice was not the normal fried rice it seemed to have a wonderful garlic flavor. 
2. Rice noodle rolls with shrimp and sweet soy sauce
One of my favorite take out sushi spots.  I even bring my friends from work here to eat lunch.  The sushi is very cheap but the quality is great.  The food is definitely fresh.  Sushi rolls that normally costs $16 for a 18 roll only costs around $7 here.  Fried rice is also good, but i normally pick this up on the way home to eat sushi.
This really sucks because no matter how good the food usually is, the rudeness and dis-respectfulness will keep me from coming back.... Ever.
To me, this restaurant serves as-close-as-you-can-get authentic Cantonese food. It used to be Food Express, but when the chef moved over to KJ Kitchen, all of his patrons switched allegiances. It has the normal, busy atmosphere that many traditional Chinese restaurants have and is quite reminiscent of a true Hong Kong establishment. The food is cheap, good, not too greasy, and just right every time. I've been to many, many Chinese restaurants such as, Kan's, HK Star, Wendy's, Chang's, Cathay House, Noodle Exchange, Cafe Noodle, Ping Pang Pong, etc., and this place definitely takes the cake. All of the classics are awesome here:
The place is connected to a gaming bar/lounge area on the other side of a swing door so they offered a full bar for beverages, but you had the bar customers coming over in to the restaurant to use the restrooms so that would be a negative I felt.
Squeezed into a small space, with a few tables and a counter taking up a lot of space, it can get a little cramped. But don't be put off!
Forget the sushi in this place, it has limited sushi from the all you can eat menu, a tease from what is on the menu if you would just pay as you go. The reason I'm not killing this place is because the Chinese food in this place is good, always liked the take out from here, but don't come here for the sushi..:(
The actual place is small quaint  and maybe have 4 booths and one large table. Immediately we were greeted by the young owner (who is super nice btw).
Great service! And delicious food :) yum. I hear they're open for Xmas! Always my first  choice for authentic Chinese food.
We got a large variety of stuff and all of it was very good and stayed super hot in the packaging. Egg Fu Young, eggrolls, Chicken Lo Mein solid -- and not really greasy or MSG-y as far as I could tell. (No gallon of water to drink for the rest of the night).
Wait time for a table- 50 minutes.  
Spend a few more bucks within the Red Rock Casino and you can get into the buffet which has the same Chinese food, and greater diversity without limit (all you can eat and drink).  Also, the cafe in the Red Rock has deals like a T-Bone steak for $10.
As if a big cup of smoothie wasn't enough, I also had to try the Thai tea boba milk tea - I love this stuff. This was a bit too sweet though. 3/5
Highly, highly recommend this restaurant.  We have eaten there a couple of times and find the food outstanding.  The portions are large so we order appetizers, 1 entrée and 1 large side.  So much food we could barely finish....but saved room for the flourless chocolate cake with real whip cream.  The staff is fun, informative and attentive.  This is my favorite Scottsdale restaurant.
I was in the area and craving Chinese. Sadly, in LV, the best I've found is Panda. But, occasionally, I get my hopes up for that little amazing hole in the wall.
- Jasmine tea smoked beef short rib, the waitress cut it up for us but it seemed like a typical dish.
I'm Chinese and I can tell you the food is not even close to authentic. Flavoring is very bland and quality is not there. There's a Hawaiian restaurant on Blue Daimond/ Target shopping center that also cook Chinese food that's way better and authentic .  The only thing this place got going for is the portion size they serve.
Argh.
Can't wait to go back again and bring more friends to this jewel. Thank you for a fun, fabulous experience!
I ordered chicken chow fun for dinner today. Relatively authenic Cantonese dish. It's a little more gravy-ish and saltier than I was expecting but overall delicious. Tender chicken and good portion size. It's a little pricey but I figured it's the Midwest. I didn't see hong kong style milk tea on the menu - so sad, oh well. It's much better than hong kong wok!
One of my friends had the Mojito which he said was pretty good. I had the Tsing Tao which was just what I needed. 
e.  Orange Chicken - I have to admit I have been known to buy this yes, at Panda Express, and really don't like it when it has such a thick layer of the flour coating. It is like a small amount of chicken, large amount of flour coating crust and too oily. Here at Grand China, the orange chicken for you all will be very authentic. There is NOT flour coating. This is the real deal.  Very, Very nice. large pieces of chicken with the right seasoning. You can taste the difference between this one and the other stuff they serve at most other places.  Very, Very nice.
BOTTOM LINE
Jasmine's saving grace is its fortunate view of the Bellagio fountains, but aside from that it's just a typical, overpriced Strip restaurant.  My party got an assortment of dishes, including the Dim Sum trio, crispy walnut prawns, general chicken, and kung pao chicken, which will be dissected below.
We started off with the lettuce wraps which my roommate had heard were amazing and they didn't disappoint. The lettuce was fresh, the sauce was spicy and the chicken was fantastic. I stayed boring with the Cashew Chicken but it was so flavorful and the chicken was so tender that I didn't regret it. 
Sure, I'd eat there again some time, but this place can't compete even with the average Chinese restaurant in the Bay Area.  You will get a plate of quite edible food here for your dollar, will get good, attentive service, and will leave full--just don't expect anything special in terms of taste.
That being said, I haven't ordered out of the chop shop yet.  They have my favorite Chinese dish, cod (or random fish filet) in black bean sauce.  It is delicious here... fresh and sure to please any fish lovers pallet.  
Little szechuan, or as that pretentious douche "PV from Portland" calls it little little Sichuan, is a tasty cheap and campy little restaurant great for lunch or dinner
I can say that through the many, many times that I've been to Flamingo I've never had an experience that made me NOT want to come back.
This is the go to place for large events like birthday dinners and Chinese New Year celebrations amongst my circle of fobby-ish friends here in Las Vegas.  Why?  Cause the food is authentic, reasonably prices, and of high quality.  Also, since we're all fairly Americanized - it's CLEAN.  Other Chinese places may have great food but you wonder if you're gonna be sick the next day or have to guess how many cockroach legs you ate.  Not here baby.
One thing I will say is that my waitress was extraordinarily nice at Little Szechuan. I was studying Arabic at the time and we had a really friendly, fun conversation about language. She helped make an incredibly dull meal an actually rewarding experience.
I have gone to the location over on Valle Verde for years and have loved this place. It's a great VERY FAST Chinese Food restaurant that serves very good food. Plus they deliver! And now they have one by my new home on the west side! Woo-hoo!
Spicy Beef Noodle soup- it was above average, not that spicy though
Wok fried lobster? OK! Delicious General Tso chicken? YES!!!! Pepper steak bits from heaven? MMMMMMMMMMMM
I live in Henderson and drive here once a week.  Do not come here if you like fancy chinese food - this is for those who want a quick, well-prepared and inexpensive chinese dinner from friendly staff.  Small unassuming place lacks a lot of energy but the food is just terrific.   Never had a bad meal there and I've eaten almost everything on the menu at one point or another.  Very unassuming and unpretentious, just good eats.
- chow mien - solid 
To say we didn't fit in was a bit of a understatement, but my co workers have gotten used to this feeling when they go to lunch with me.
It's slightly too expensive for what you're getting.  Also, I didn't really like the flavor of my noodle dish.
Great food, low prices, and huge quantity! So excited to have a Chinese place near my office!
I guess I'm staying away from the mixed seafood for a bit, but maybe too it was an off night. Still it's enough for the BF not wanting to go back. I'll try to try it alone and weigh in on it again.
What do you call those days in between Christmas and New Year? Is there a name for them? Whatever they're called, I doubt anyone can really be bothered cooking and so the hunt for an excellent takeaway is on!
I use this Place for delivery whenever I don't want Pizza or Burgers. The food is fine not the best but for the price its just fine. Plus delivery is fast.
To my fellow yelpers: The southside is a place that is special to my heart. Perseverant, rough and colorful... there are places where it can be scary to venture into... but stay on the main roads and be a polite driver and you should be alright. Go and pay the Wong's a visit but don't be surprised if Mrs. Wong isn't exactly a happy camper. lol. Try the chicken wings, they're GREAT!
  The menu is large, with lots of seafood, and separated into categories by the meat used in the main dish.  There are certainly some strange dishes (snake anyone?) so I stuck to the safe,  tried and true American white guy favorite dishes.
It's all been very good here, but I'm a freak for their egg rolls, mei fun and chow fun. If you haven't had mei or chow fun before you have to try it here. However their most killer-est dish is the roast pork lo mein. I'm typically disappointed by pork dishes from AZ Chinese restaurants; regardless of the dish the pork is usually bland and/or dry. That's not the case here, the pork is seasoned and roasted well. Spicy beef it a close runner up to the pork lo mein (and is really done justice by a night in the fridge), so be sure to hit some up as well.
Tried China Jade for the first time yesterday. The food is delicious. Well at least the House Fried Rice and Hot and Sour Soup were delicious. I love the ability to order online and pop in to pick up and pay. I'll be back to try more menu items.
The cashier was friendly, which earned them another star. But man, the food was baaaad. We only finished it because we were starving! When we left we wished we had gone to Manuel's after all!
Granted, not the best Chinese food I ever had but definitely the best I've had in the West Valley.  I would say if it were in any other place like NY, LA, Houston, I would have given it 3 stars but for Phoenix, definitely 4.  The service was also very good, which you don't usually see in Chinese restaurants.  I ain't hatin' either - it's just the way it is.  :)
Because its a relative bargain, and because of the spectacular view of the fountain show, I would go three stars on Jasmine, but there is nothing else to recommend it.
First off, this place is just a really cool looking restaurant. Really pretty and well-decorated, with a modern-Asian flair. 
We ordered per the waittresses suggestion, the House specialty, spicy chicken and the Shanghai noodles.  
We've been going here off and on for a couple years now.
While visiting Phoenix and sick of the chain restaurant options surrounding my hotel at the MetroCenter, a quick search on Yelp uncovered Mr. Wong. Unfortunately, I could not locate a menu online so I just called and had a quick chat with the woman who answered the phone. I initially asked for Szechuan chicken but was told they did not offer it, but followed quickly with other options to consider. Since I needed to hit the $15 minimum for delivery I ordered more than I needed. I started with hot and sour soup that ended up being quite hardy and included shrimp. My main dish was hot and spicy chicken which came with solid heat and flavor. To put me over the minimum I also ordered crab puffs since the woman on the phone recommended them. I'm typically not a fan of anything puffed, but these were not overwhelmingly fried. My food arrived in under 30 minutes and there was no additional delivery charge. For just randomly picking a restaurant of Yelp with few reviews, I was pleasantly surprised by what I received. I dug it and would order again if I'm ever back in the area.
Wow, that was good Chinese food.  I went at lunch and the place was packed and took about ten minutes to get a table.  The prices were a bit high but you get a ton of food.  Service was good... the staff are all Asian, they want to get you in and out fast which is great...  I'll be back
FOOD: wanted to really enjoy it, but honestly, the food was detestable. We both  nearly gagged just after tasting it. To say our food was dissatisfactory is an understatement. STAY AWAY!!!! PRICE: Wasn't worth the price even if it was free.. SERVICE: Fast delivery.  CONCLUSION:  I have rarely been this disappointed with a restaurant . If I could give this place 0 stars I would. This is the worst chinese restaurant ever!
A great, authentic, great tasting chinese restaurant. My favorite dish is the Salt & pepper pork chops. The mandarin pork chops are also really good. I have been coming here for 10 plus years. They are great for groups.
orange chicken
I decided to try some food and ordered the spicy tuna roll & cucumber salad.
I've heard up and down reviews about Red Shrimp.  The reason my work went with this place for our luncheon was because of their ad placed in one of the local papers.  It had coupons for some extras with qualifying orders.  I'm guessing we got a decent deal for the food to feed 60+ folks.
same on you pong pong.
I've had an overall tough-go at uncovering a decent Chinese food spot outside of Chinatown but this particular China-a-Go-Go was impressive. I ordered delivery and my Chicken Kung Pao was seriously awesome. They also arrived less than 30 minutes after I ordered which is record timing for delivery of anything other than craptacular Domino's pizza.  The veggies were fresh and crisp, the spice was right on and the Corn Flower soup was amaze! Will definitely hit this place up again when the craving calls.
At $6.99, you get a satisfying meal in soup, fried rice, spring roll and your choice of dish off their lunch specials. 
-Salt & Pepper Chicken Wings
Fantastic. Personalized service (she knows my name and order when I call) and genuinely nice people and dine-in quality food.
Food was fresh enough, but couldn't find a trace of actual flavor anywhere... Highlight of the meal was the Coke, with the egg drop soup coming in 2nd place... And that was only after I doctored it up a bit.  Hubby had hot & sour soup, a double lie.  Potstickers were huge & cooked perfect, but no flavor to them nor in the dipping sauce (tasted like watered down soy only).  Hubby's General Tso's Chicken was very bland, and the chicken was very dry. My Chicken Chow Mein (soft noodles) was also very bland, but at least the chicken was moist.  I boxed mine to take home for doctoring up, but his food was left behind to be tossed out.  All in all, a very disappointing experience.
Cilantro, green onions, cabbage, broccoli, mushrooms, pineapple, zucchini?...all right I'll try some healthy shit.  
Fish maw and crab soup, garlic stir fried pea shoots, salt and pepper pork, mapo tofu.  All fantastic.  My favorite is the steamed fish with scallions and ginger, but make sure you bring enough people--  the smallest sized fish is usually 2+ pounds, so, sadly mostly too much for 2 people...
Overall, this is definitely a place I recommend!
It's China Magic you know
 The place was more expensive than I thought it would be.  I think the price range should be adjusted to Moderate $$. 
It was a 4 star place. But that definitely knocked it down a notch, and it would of been lower if I actually ate it.
I was super let down that their wasn't a Chinese guy in there pulling noodles.  Kinda like when Clark made it all the way to Wally World and it was closed.
I was impressed.  No, this is not the best, most impressive Chinese you will ever have.  It is close to typical.  However, there's something about it that makes it just a hair bit better than your *good* average place, and I've found a lot of bad average places, so I think this deserves 4 stars.  Just keep in mind that it is CHEAP and is not going to blow your mind.  But if you're looking for a safe bet for Chinese, head on down here.
One might wonder what is hiding behind those steamy windows.  When you push the door, it feels inded like a steam room and the formica tables surprise you a bit.  But don't be put off!  This place is a little gem.
1. Red 8 (yummiest)
The food was as beautiful as the decor, and just about everything was pretty tasty. The cuisine primarily stays true to traditional Chinese, not moving towards more Western fusion influences that a lot of other high-end Asian restaurants do. As a result, the food felt very comfortable in a way; but make no mistake, it was also significantly more refined than the average Chinese restaurant (and the prices reflect that).
The meal came a free order of crab puffs, so there's that.
Simultaneously the good and bad side to this is that everything is made fresh to order, so if you don't ask well before you've finished what's already on the table, you're left sitting for a goodly while before more sails toward you. And, in the case of my beloved chicken dumplings, you might have to ask a couple of times. Given the size of the place and the number of replenishing orders they must take from people, it's unsurprising and somewhat forgiveable that the occasional order goes astray.
One thing good about this place is that they are open till 5am on fri, sat and sun and the rest of the days till 3am which is pretty late. My wife and I like to order the chicken chowmein, mayo shrimp, ma po tofu and the deep fried marinated chicken. If you looking for a Chinese restaurant late at night, this is the place.
Ok, I stayed.  Here it is...
Soooo tasty! And the service is great, even when the restaurant is super busy. I love the salad before you get your order too (always free, and always included) - there's nothing better than sitting down to instant food rather than having to wait for your order of appetizers to arrive.
Sorry, I had to subtract because I came in here for lunch with a coworker.. we ordered at the same time.. his meal came out quickly.. mine did not. My plate came out about 10 minutes after his.
This is strictly a review of the food. The service was good but the food could have been much better. I won't compare it or say I should have gone to XYZ, but its nothing to write home about in my opinion. Better options out there.
I'm normally not a 5 star giver however I am very impressed and might I add full from this place. I had the food delivered after searching Yelp for chinese delivery. The food arrived faster than a pizza and it was HOT! I had the orange chicken and shrimp and asked for it not to be spicy and it wasn't. My son is a picky eater like lo mien but not the veggies and they hooked him up with chicken lo mien only. So we are sold!
Not the greatest, but not the worst Chinese food. Not a big fan of the prices, but good portions.
It was closer to 3 than 4, mainly because the shrimp fried rice was a bit too salty for my taste, but it was a generous portion like all the other yelpers mentioned. The people working there were pretty friendly too.
SuiWok is cheap, the food is great, and there's always leftovers.  Mmmm, leftovers.
The staff was busy and it showed.  Not unpleasant, but not taking the time to be all smiley and such, either.  I got my food, so I didn't really care.
I have had the pleasure of trying almost everything on their menu, as I have been going here for years. Good quality, HUGE portions, but the servers can make you feel rushed to order and pay sometimes. They're open pretty late on Friday and Saturday, 10pm, so that's nice if you live downtown since most places close when the sun goes down. 
I don't get what's with other reviewers complaining about this place's cleanliness/quality.  The building's old, but everything's plenty clean.  As a general rule, I'd say the dishes that have no sauces or seasoning listed on the menu are pretty light on seasoning and sauces, so order something more flavorful if that's not what you'd like :).
I was expecting Chinese cuisine but they cater to An American palate, but it was still good.
I'm never disappointed in the quality of the takeout and visit regularly.
I was debating on what to eat and decided to come here. Ordered the honey chicken for lunch and thought it was alright. The customer service was good and even offered water for me waiting. The vibe of the restaurant seems quiet and nice. I think the place is worth a try to those craving some chinese.
This small restaurant is a real gem;behind the opaque black glass doors there are all sorts of locally made art and traditional chinese instruments mounted upon the walls, the only real downside is the small one person bathrooms that have the habit of being quite unkempt. 
Being from the east coast, i do get a little uppity about certain kinds of foods. For example, most Chinese places down here look at you funny if you as for duck sauce (an orange sweet and sour type sauce that comes on the table along w/ house hot mustard back east). I took a chance here and put in my comments at the end of my order: please include hot mustard (not packets) & duck sauce. And they did. :)
A party of 4 of us came in for dinner before seeing "O". The surrounding restaurants in the hotel we booked and had long wait. We should have known by the emptiness of Jasmine that it was a sign for what was to come. 
Food here was just ok, and I'm pretty sure they are using MSG still. Every dish (including the house special chicken over which everyone was raving) was heavily salted and just plain bland tasting. Three stars awarded for quick and attentive service and reasonable prices. But I won't be returning.
We ordered egg rolls, vegetable egg rolls, vegetable egg foo young, beef chow mein and chicken moo shu. All were amazingly good, and fresh. That's the key: really, really fresh.
This place certainly isn't amazing. Nor is it very fresh. It is greasy 'Chinese' food made for Americans. That being said, for what it is, it's not terrible. My family has been getting food from here for over ten years. It has always been about the same. The place is really for take out, it has tables, but looks like a fast food place. They recently got a new menu board that reminds me of Panda Express... ha. Anyway, on to the food, we got a large take out order from here last night for father's day. It was one of the better tasting endeavors from this place. We ordered mu shu pork, chicken chow fun, mongolian beef, shrimp in lobster sauce, orange chicken, and we got honey wings for free (if you order more than 29$ worth of food they give you a free appetizer from a list... pretty cool). I was glad we tried the chow fun, because I have had their chow mein many times and the noodles are always greasy and limp and the chicken tastes weird.... well the chow fun had white meat chicken and was less greasy, so that was nice. The mu shu was fine and the mongolian beef was pretty good. 
So would I go back? YES
Best Chinese food in the Valley!  I love their beef pies and usually get those first. I also think their beef in chili oil is delicious.   Another great one is Cumin Beef. Owner is extremely nice and always welcoming. Ive never been to China but Ive been told this is authentic northern Chinese food.
Food was average priced (just under $18 for two dinners, no drinks) and came out fast.
Plus that they do lunch specials, but also a special combo meal available all day of a dish + fried rice + eggroll and rangoon. 
Love this place... I would say it is 90% consistent in the preparation of my favorite dishes... meaning 90% of the time is the ideal taste and texture... the other 10% it's still good but just not the way I really like it. 
Ive been here twice now - once with just my wife, and once with my whole family. Both were good experiences.
And by the number of tables, crowd may be an understatement.
pupu platter: poop poop - egg rolls tasteless, bbq pork overcooked, flavorless chicken wings and drumettes, fried shrimp (neutral) crab puffs, (deflating)
Not sure what happened to the review I posted couple of weeks ago.  Anyway, been back to this tiny hole in the wall restaurant about 5 times since (mostly for their dirt cheap lunch specials).  So I feel I have more to share about this place than my original review, which was just on the hot pot experience during their opening weekend promotion.
Chicken chow fun with black beans
I really loved this restaurant.   I love fresh noodles and I ran over after seeing they make them to order.  They do this in some areas of China and the beef noodle soup tasted just like I had when I was in Bejing for the first time 15 years ago.  I recommend bringing your children in to see this man make noodles and have a nice, casual, well made, delicious,  inexpensive bite!
This place is THE Chinese restaurant to eat at in vegas. Very reasonably priced and the food is just  INCREDIBLE!!! You can't go wrong with this place.
The plates were pretty gross. It seems like they just wipe off the top of the plates before they put them back. The bottom of the plates seemed dirty. Why do the bottom of the plates matter? Think about this: when the plates are stacked, what are the eating surfaces of the plates in contact with?
Entrees:
A solid 5-stars review for the restaurant's lunch specials.
If you are going to have real plants, then you have to clean up when they drop their leaves.
Wow! This place is fantastic! Be careful though...portions are huge, especially the kids menu. Everything is very flavorful, it's not covered in goo, veggies are crispy and fresh. Fast, friendly service. Check it out.
The main dish was soggy and SALTY. I can make it better myself at home (which I should have done but was too lazy...boo me). The fried rice was not fried rice. It was just white rice with soy sauce splashed on it. The egg roll was super greasy and bland and I didn't even eat the lobster cream cheese things.
Ever since I went for my 21st  birthday a year ago, every time my family and I visit Vegas, we come here. We have never had a bad experience and the food is always amazing. Each waiter we have had has met our expectations. The sushi rolls are some of the freshest and delicious sushi we have ever had. I can't wait until we go back because it is definitely a routine for us to come here!
She ordered the rice cakes and green tea. 
What I first noticed as I walked into Beijing restaurant was how uncomfortably hot it was inside.  It felt as if the air conditioning was turned off.  I was glad I had placed a take out order.  The restaurant was empty but it still took several minutes for someone to help me.  The staff wasn't very friendly but maybe it was due to how uncomfortable it was inside.
I've been to other Asian restaurants on the strip, and they have one or more of the following issues: low quality food, sad excuses for portions, and/or overpriced dishes.  It's odd to say, but fortunately Hakkasan only suffers from that third one.
My sensitivity to MSG didn't come into play.  It's hard to imagine Chinese style BBQ without MSG, but since I couldn't detect any I'd have to say this place did it right.  The health score of "A" was quite reassuring too.  That's something I don't see that often in San Francisco!
The girl behind the counter was cute aside from pinky-picking at her nose and not covering a sneeze (ahem); the guy behind the counter was helpful aside from being a bit hard to understand and not covering his coughs (ahem); the cockroach behind the counter crawling down the wall was harmless aside from being a cockroach (ahem). I'm not sure if these things will stop me from ever going back when in the mood for cheap Chinese.
I will try them again and hope it is better.
New York New York is where the foodies come to party.
I was not.
I actually really liked China Olive the first few times I went there, even if it was a little inconsistent and sometimes it was very fresh and other times not so much.
So, $245 for Peking duck, $188 per order of abalone, worth it?  Elevated to this level, bloody well right.
Despite feeling like you might get carjacked, stabbed or robbed every second while waiting for your food, this place is excellent!  To avoid a wait while outside of their window, I suggest  calling ahead, however, you can walk up and order.  Usually the gal who answers says it'll be 10 minutes...be prepared for a 20-25 minute wait at times.  I am a fan of the veggie egg fu young, steamed broccoli, sesame chicken, orange chicken, egg drop soup sans chicken, french fries, fried mushrooms (these are huge, like as big as tomatoes)..the list goes on.  Their combo plates have fed our family of four when we've also added an appetizer.  It's truly some of the best Chinese I've had in downtown Phoenix.  I'd equate this place to any dive Chinese joint in a large city like NY, Chicago, etc.  It looks totally unappealing but is a treasure! I have never seen anything bad happen here but  I always wear closed-toe shoes and have my hair pulled back when going here.......It seems less scary during the daytime and when the guys who work at the car repair shop right across the street are still around which I have seen be as late as 8.  Please give this little place a shot and, remember, it's cash only!!  And, there's no ATM on site either.
Cool moment though:  while we were sitting there eating, Pete Rose walked in and ate dinner a couple of tables over from us.  It's not every day that you can say you dined next to a legend!
Very above average Chinese food.  We had the szechuan meal for 2, which is quite a bit of food.  We did this on purpose, as we wanted to try several items since it was our first time.  The fried rice was of much higher quality that I've had before.  The veggies were clearly fresh, a lot had a "snap" or crispness to them.  You could taste the egg and pork in the rice.
- Huge menu
Probably the least expensive of the upscale Bellagio restaurants, Jasmine is standard Chinese, although they try to prepare dishes with a bit of flair.  The whole crispy fish was competently prepared, moderately large, and tasty, especially with the spicy tomato sauce that comes on the side.  Unfortunately, nothing else was very good, and one chicken dish was absolutely bad -- undercooked chicken, yech!
Regretfully I will not be going back to China Way until they return the recipes that made them so good. If you read this China Way I hope you take this to heart and work to keep your loyal customers of many years.
Ok, granted we were here when Wynn first opened, this place sucked! the service was extremely terrible. the food was mediocre! Gosh....we were not happy at all! This place probably got better but, first impression, "hell no!"
9. Chicken Teriyaki on a Stick -  Good, enjoyable, will order again, but not my personal favorite. 
Chicken Egg Foo Young - Hands down, the best egg foo young in town. The patties were generously sized and the gravy was to die for.
The third thing you will notice, is that they only have two large tables and three small tables as the majority of their business is take out. However, we elected to dine-in but I'm married. If you're single this may not be the place to take your date as the ambiance is more like you would expect from a take out place than a restaurant. However, if you don't mind simplicity and want great food for great prices this is your place!
Decor/Ambiance was pleasant. Music playing in the background was not Chinese, but instrumentals of popular American songs, which you probably wouldn't even pay attention to unless you focus on it.
They have two menus: chinese style and American style.
It was alright, I can make better noodles for damn sure. Not much to say about this place. It is, what it is. 
The Sweet and Sour pork was pretty below average, as their fried dough was too thick and the quality of pork was below par.  
Great place for cheap chinese lunch! I love their spicy garlic chicken! They have a really good flavor. Additionally, it's finally nice to find a restaurant that has consistency. Every time I had their spicy garlic chicken, it always tasted the same (:
Excellent authentic, Asian dishes, and the personalized service is what brings us back!
a)  Unique decor - fits in with Vegas style completely.
No dim sum, no bueno.
Unless your rolling in the dough and can afford this meal only to expect mediocre tastes then go for it other wise i would suggest some place else.
Customer service is always and I mean always bad here and the food is just ehhh also but I continue to go here for a bowl of white rice which that they can screw up.
They don't use MSG. +++
lots of good Chinese food in Vegas and KJ Kitchen is right up there.  started with spring rolls.  they were light and crispy and full of flavor.  I also tried the pot-stickers.  they were plump and full of pork but lacked some flavor.  they would have benefitted from some green onion and ginger and a complimentary sauce.  we also shared the crispy noodles with shrimp.  very nice dish.  we also had the mandarin pork chop.  it was excellent.  just be sure you have extra napkins.  finally, we had the chicken with crispy skin.  it was my favorite dish.  one of my dinner companions felt it was a little too salty but I thought it was delightful.  lots of flavor with crispy skin and juicy chicken.  not an easy thing to accomplish.  the beer could have been colder.
The staff is always really welcoming and quick with the refills. 
You can stop by the reception of the restaurant to make reservations throughout the day, if you are not able to reach the hostess via phone.
Now for the Fried Rice. Wow. No, not the good kind of wow. The what the heck just happened wow. The Fried Rice was not the typical fried rice I was used to. There was like nothing in it. You know like peas, carrots, onions, etc. It seemed like they put a couple drops of soy sauce and mixed in a quarter of an egg. It didnt have much flavor to it. 
First off my iced tea was great. I know that sounds lame to care about the quality of the iced tea, but most places I go it's so watered down and has no flavor at all. So this place was already on my good side.
Quick, tasty, cheap.  Not the healthiest though.
I read the reviews and thought I'd still give it a try. Not a good idea. The tofu was silken and had absolutely no flavor or texture. The noodles were overcooked. The soup was bland (though they did remember to give hot sauce, which helped). The cabbage was the only semi saving grace. Also, it was quick and filling. Not recommended, but not terrible.
Then, we found Jade Palace.
Then, to top it off...she wants my credit card number to write on the check.  WHAT FOR?
Egg Roll - Amen!  I've been longing for this for quite some time.  Again, exactly like what I'm used to.  I've had such a hard time finding good egg rolls.
I know its Chinese food, but still, let's keep some sort of standards here folks. You know it's bad when you leave saying, "We should have just eaten at Taco Bell." Too bad they were closed.
Ehhh pretty good food. They have some real chinese dishes that other places don't really serve. Kind of pricey though. Staff is also not pleasant. Feels like you should sit down, eat and leave in 20 mins cause of how dull everyone there is. Oh well not expecting to see waiters using crumbers at places like this. Will keep going back and hope they warm up to me
If i'm in the mood for spicy noodles I get their  Singapore noodles with chicken. 
One of THE best Chinese restaurants around. Each time I order from here, they never disappoint.  We've got quite a "gem" here in Anthem with this establishment.
My friend was right about the noodles.  They were as fresh as egg noodles go and perfectly cooked (egg noodles are usually overcooked in most places).  I ordered the BBQ duck and pork & shrimp wonton noodle soup.  The wontons were a good size and very delicious.  The BBQ duck was all right, a little on the bland side.  The noodles certainly were the highlight.
Fortunately I expensed the eightygodddamnedollars I spent here or I'd be really pissed. Oh, and the fruit is sour.
The lamb riblets are coated with cumin and other spices, quick fried and then wok-fried with whole dried chilies, Szechwan numbing red peppercorns and caramelized onions.  This is a finger-lickin' tasty dish which you have to eat with your fingers unless you have amazing chopstick skills. 
*Note* As other reviewers have said, the beef tends to be a little chewy.
7475 Mineral Point Road, 
Love the crispy green beans and dynamite shrimp.  My hubby like the General Tao's.  Service was good.  YUM craving crispy green beans now.... may have to go for lunch today :)
- Incredibly authentic Chinese food.
Deep Fried Tofu Stuffed w/ Pork & Shrimp - a very unusual dish which I don't recall ever seeing on a chinese menu...FABULOUS!
This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in all Las Vegas. It may not be the nicest place since it may be in need of some remodeling, but is still the place with the best food and best value!
 Large portions, arrived in a reasonable amount of time, and got here hot and crispy.  Good value and decent food.
We tried the following:
My friend got their Shrimp Pad Thai. We got it to go. While we were waiting for the food, we found out they delivered and we live close. So that was a plus. When the food was ready we couldn't help ourselves but taste it. We finished it. As well as the wontons. Keep in mind we had just finished eating at Capriotti's. I also had to get another Boba to go.
Parking (5 stars) 
Went to dinner here last night and was a great experience. There was so much food to choose from and decently priced. The popcorn chicken and grilled short ribs were great. I went with a group of 4 and the best looking dish was the Lemongrass Clay Pot chicken. Very nicely put together. Will definitely be going back to try more.
Some menu items just don't translate well into English, you'll find many dishes with names like "beef with pickled pig intestines." We skip those.
Their Lo Mein noodles are also good and they never take issue when I order my Chicken Lo Mein with no veggies. Sometimes all a man needs is some chicken and noodles and they do it up proper. 
This was the first time we both had food poisoning and can't say it was fun. Since all our other experience was great and the owners are fantastic, I can't rate one star but after that experience, there is no way we will be returning.
Not worth your dime even if the lunch special is under $10. 
Simply the best chinese take out I have ever had. the steamed vegetables with tofu are not only healthy but also delicious. Very surprised! PS: You will love this place if you are from Taiwan like me.
For my entree, I ordered the Singapore-styled noodles with shrimp, chicken, and veggies. Yes, the portions may be small for the average men, but for females...you will have leftovers if not, the perfect sized. My friend said her entree was delicious as well.
Soda is sold by the can, just FYI.
a. Chow Mein
O and finally... The egg rolls. They tasted like classic east coast egg rolls.
Best of all: this location has 7-11--style icees. I think I also recall seeing boba tea. I'll be back...
I had the Fried rice cake with egg and soy sauce, steamed pork ribs with rice noodles, and flaming hot cheesy chicken.  Finished with mango crepes.
*no happy hour
We ordered from the $118 prix fixe menu but they also have prix fixe menus starting at $66 as well as a la carte. We had a vegetarian in the group and their vegetarian options actually seemed promising enough for me to want to try it. But no, I'm a carnivore - who am I kidding? From the signature menu, we got a lot of dishes.
This place is located in a strip mall, downstairs from my favorite place in 
Seeing all the cars parked in their parking lot and as it was time for lunch, I decided to give it a try.  The staff was very efficient.  I think I waited a whole 10 minutes to get my food.  I ordered the Mongolian beef.  The sauce was too sweet and the meat-well it reminded me of mystery meat.  Not a very memorable meal.
I'm Chinese and from NJ. I've spent a lot of time having authentic Chinese food in Chinatown, NY as I lived very close to Manhattan. I've had my fair share of Chinese takeout places (which is not authentic) back at home. I tried a couple places when I moved to Las Vegas last year -- Grand China and China-a-Go-Go -- and I thought they were okay for what they were. When we moved to Summerlin (we were up in Aliante previously), I was excited to try this place because they boast that their food is New York style Chinese. At first, I thought that mean the food was like what you'd find in a Chinatown, not Chinese takeout, and I thought it was kinda neat that there was a place like this closer to where we were (although I don't mind having to go to Las Vegas' "Chinatown" for some good Chinese food; my favorites so far are KJ Kitchen and Joyful House). However, after reading the reviews here, it seemed like my first impression was incorrect. The first time we ordered from here further confirmed that. I don't really know what NY style supposed to mean. To me, there's just real Chinese food and there's Americanized Chinese food. This would fall under the latter. 
I don't know, maybe I shouldn't give this place such a good review then, but the rice and mongolian beef make me love getting food from here
Kung Pao Chicken or Shrimp
  Their lunch specials top off at $6.25. Of course, if you dining in, I suggest a tip. Similar to the majority of Chinese restaurants, a shrimp's entry is the top priced item. ($6.25).
I called originally to *request only a portion* of my bill be taken off and ***ended the call *** with actually having to call my bank and dispute the bill in it's entirety! I tipped the driver pretty well too...and I'll be damned if I give any more money to this place now or ever!  Ai have the food in my fridge and as soon as I get in touch with my bank's ACH Disputes Dept. I'm going to have Big WA's driver come pick up their nasty food as proof! {Since that's what the person who I spoke with at Big Wa asked me to do after all, return my food as proof!) How ridiculous! This place is bad. Don't support this local restaurant! There's got to be better places....Keep looking until you find one with GREAT food AND customer service!
For a new restaurant, they were extremely well-run and exceeded my expectations.  I look forward to dining here again in the near future and trying some of the other items on the extensive menu.
The overall layout and feel of the place is appealing and inviting.  The staff is top notch and really push this into solid 4 star rating.  Even the bus boy...err, man...was super polite and very attentive.  This is something I have come to expect from the MGM properties staff.
I would never eat here again. We ordered delivery, as I am moving and packing. This place about a mile from my home. When speaking with the woman who answered the phone, she couldn't understand what I was asking for and I couldn't understand her broken English. I was promised our order within 45 minutes. I called back after an hour and was told it would be here in 5 minutes. 15 minutes later our food arrived, an hour an 15 min after I had ordered. We ordered Tso's chicken, chicken lo mien, vegetable fried rice, and fried wontons. 
*Ring, Ring* 
The Magic Noodle was our first stop after getting off the plane for our AZ weekend and we were pleasantly surprised at how good the noodles were. In particular the "seafood with cream sauce" dish which sounds totally disgusting (and not much better looking) but was the best dish of the day. Of course, be sure to order all of your noodle dishes with the hand pulled noodle option.
for those who are use to the old Orient House may find that they do not like the new change. I certainly do not. 
I've always wanted to try this place but I always just drive by it on the way home. Finally, I decided to try it and I have probably made the best decision doing so. The staff here are nice and when I came through the door I was greeted and seated. I ordered takeout orange chicken with rice. The food was made to order and delicious.  Food tastes authentic and comes in great portions. Definitely will be coming back soon.
I have a confession.
Overall review is a decent place nothing special but you won't be unhappy you came... If you have a few of the better dishes - it just might make you smile :)
I wouldn't drive a long way to get here but I definitely suggest giving it a try if you are in the area......you can thank me later for the great suggestion! :)
The waitstaff was pretty much what you would expect.  Nothing too spectacular except the hostess was wearing a chipau (sp?) with a really long slit on the side.
My gripe with the store is that they sold out.  Yes it may have similar tastes to the restaurants back home, but they sold out to try to fit the norm of Scottsdale.  Prices have risen for no apparent reason.  Fried Rice is close to $7 taxed!  That is an outrage.  I think they should take off the NY AUTHENTIC scheme and just go with a bland ARIZONA CHINESE RESTAURANT title, because that is what is has succumb to.
unfortunately Pick Up stix is closed all their locations in AZ and in NV. I never understand. I loved this place. 1000x better than the Panda or Pei Wei.. heck i liked it better than P.F Changs which all belong to the same company. put it this way... its where I spent my 2008 Valentine's Dinner I liked it that much. Ah well.. I guess I'll have to hit up San Diego to eat it once again..
That's why he liked it and that's what I experienced at lunch that day. Pretty good service as well. I'm not sure if it was because they recognized my mom who would have always been with my dad - or if it's the norm however, the server was attentive, friendly and overall, pretty good. 
I'd like to try your dim sum as long as the piano player lady isn't there.
Everything was tasty and plentiful. The Mongolian beef was particularly good.  The Mongolian beef is delicately sliced, very lean, flavorful, and melts in your mouth. My fellow "yelpers" this is Mongolian beef perfection. I couldn't find a single flaw, I just couldn't and now my mouth is watering.
Nice place. Good food. Good service.
My go to delivery Chinese spot..from that category you gotta know what to expect but the Wok definitely steps it up over any other delivery place that I know of in the area.
Chen & Wok gets four starts for convenience, price and they deliver!!!  And it's Chinese food that's actually delivered in the Chinese take out boxes.  I love that.
+ Of course, white rice which did not disappoint. 
Ice creams and sorbets: An assortment of three different flavors. I think one of them was like a mint greek yogurt and it was BLAH! I spit it out. Sorry I'm not sorry. 
I was in town for business and got back to my hotel around 7PM (dinner time). Having work to do for my client, I decided that I would order food to be delivered to my room and chinese food sounded great! 
My fellow yelpers, I present to you a brief review in Engrish.
Should've read some of the reviews. 
We look forward to visiting again and trying items off the not-so-secret "Chinese-only" menu they have.  For now, the stuff on the menu they give to everybody is pretty awesome.  
I would definitely go here again. They have good food and great prices. I can't wait to go back again! In the end, the five of us ate for under $40. That is a very rare thing now a days.
Service is slow and the staff seems almost upset to be at work.
Mm mm mm! I miss Chinese Food takeout/delivery from NYC. I was a bit skeptical when the suggestion came up for "good chinese". But heck, I'll try anything once.
The wait service for my last meal with a group of friends was better at 6:30 PM on a Saturday. We've got service from 3 different wait staffs. They were serving everybody else too. Not just us.
If you try to give your pallet new experiences, flavors, you may NOT have ever tasted, there is a dish for you.  Although, I must warn you.  It is spicy!
The lanzhou noodles broth is also mildly spicy. It has a dark smokey flavor that I liked also. This is on my list of places to eat in Las Vegas.
The Lamb Soup Pot was the better choice of mini pot that we had ordered at our table.  Interestingly, as we work our way towards the bottom of the hot pot, we noticed pieces of seafood in the Lamb Soup Pot as well.  Not sure if that was intentional, but we enjoyed it regardless.
I came here for happy hour from 4-7pm.  $5 drinks and appetizers.  The ginger mojito was amazing - big chunks of fresh ginger.  So yummy, but you must love ginger. The happy hour sushi rolls were also quite good.  I'm usually not a fan of Philadelphia rolls but this one came with pesto, which was excellent.  The rolls were half rolls but they were only $5.  I think they must have lowered their HH prices since Robyn visited in April.
-Crab Rangoon: it tasted like 98% cream cheese. It was like eating a big spoonful of it with no crab whatsoever.
P.S.  Our waiter was awesome and cute ; )
Small place. Good Chinese food. This place is easy to miss. Blink once and you may find yourself making a u-turn. Their house specialties are pretty good. Try to stay away from the traditional menu since all places make these dishes differently. I personally like the spicy shrimp with shell, porkchops Peking style, honey walnut shrimp and the spare ribs in black bean sauce. They have oxtail soup, which I shall definitely try on my next visit. this place is really small and is not for the intimacy freaks. The lunch specials are quite cheap but the entrees and specials can add up quick.
It's Chinese alright. 
Two hours later I felt something, something dark and painful.  This stuff RIPPED my stomach up.  Being at work, this made for some awkward meetings, that's for sure.
- Ready in 10min 
The "Orange Chicken" only comes in large size on the menu, but if you order it from the kids menu you can get the small portion. If you still want the larger portion then you might want to order the combination dinner meal with the Orange Chicken because then you will get a choice of Soup, Rice, an Egg Roll and a Crab Rangoon for $8.95 and the Orange Chicken alone is $8.55. Might as well get more for your meal for just 40 cents more.
Beware of the fried rice!  
The service is super friendly and they seem very family operated. They deliver, which is also fantastic.
The end of the meal, he gives it 2.5 stars, and I give it 3 stars.  Will we be returning?  Not sure...
All in all I'd say this is one of the better Chinese places in the east valley.
Service was fast ... one might say, "too fast":  in a take-out situation, you WANT them falling over each other.  At a sit down meal, you really don't want them bringing courses before you're done with the previous one.  As I said to my fellow diner, "The only thing missing is them standing in a corner, watching expectingly and waiting to swoop down on us as we took our last bite."
Favorite. 
Decided to try lunch as it was close to my home.  Went in and was surprised to get both fried rice and chow mein, instead of having to choose one.  Also, went there for dinner, it was good.  My complaint was I ordered the large party trays for my sons b-day party.  I spent almost $200 and was not given anything extra such as crab puffs, egg rolls, etc.  NOTHING!!  When I ordered party trays from Jacky Chan, they gave me crab puffs, which are my favorites.  We haven't been to Rice n noodle, since and never will.  We aren't asking for hand-outs, but when we spend a couple hundred, include something extra, even a fortune cookie would have sufficed, but nothing gets you NO MORE OF OUR BUSINESS!!!!!!!!!!!!
We would never go back, but the place gets a second star just for offering a $4.75 lunch special a block off the strip.
Hostess: Can I help you?
Suuuuuuuuuch good delivery Chinese/Chinese-American. I can't get enough. I don't know of another place of this caliber with DOLLAR DELIVERY (okay, maybe my mind is warped from years in Chicago, I don't know) and six-dollar seafood dishes if you get the dinner special. My favorite is the Squid with Chili and Spicy Salt but everything I have had so far has been delectable. I miss Chicago's Chinatown, but Orient House totally makes up for that when I'm feeling glum.
The cold appetizers - tofu, white - not spicy, greenish (not sure if that was tofu, but hey, I don't really mind. If it tastes good I'll try it!)  - little spicy, pig ear - spicy. All were delish!
Had the singapore noodles, they were OK - not great but OK.  Great patio seating to people watch on Scottsdale road.  The female bartenders are nice on the eyes.
This is pretty cheap compare to other place on the strip. Expensive compare to places like Chinatown. I had the shrimp fried rice and wanton noodle soup. It was good. But I have to admit I've had better but still very good. I would come back to this place. I wish I could of try other noodle soup.
       - $9.95 Half Roast Duck - Duck was a little dry. I didn't see hanging ducks anywhere so I think they might buy their duck elsewhere and serve it.
Though the noodles, their flagship product, aren't my favorite, I can say that they had excellent service.   We were seated immediately, and almost as soon as we sat down, water was at our place settings.  Additionally, time between placing our order, and when the first dish was delivered, was relatively quick, and when it arrived to the table, it was piping hot.  It is one of the "casual" dining spots in The Venetian, so don't expect a meal to write home about.  However, as I hinted earlier, if you're in need of balancing your liquid-to-solid ratio, after boozing, then head on over there.
I was hoping for some good Chinese Green Tea as is complimentary at most Chinese Restaurants, however they charged by the person, so I skipped that.
Can't believe I didn't know about this place until just a few days ago! Wendy's features Cantonese and Hong Kong style food and snacks. I was greeted as soon as I walked in and after being seated I was immediately brought a cup of hot tea and a plate of peanuts. Nice! Off to a good start already.
We have enjoyed the lovely music from the harpist many times while dining.  Wonderful place.
We called ahead and asked for the broccoli and beef (large).  
I haven't had the chance to experience much stellar Chinese food here in Vegas - until now!  It was mid-afternoon and I ordered the Kung Pao Tofu with Noodles as a lunch special.  Those legendary homemade noodles of which everyone speaks were stellar and perfectly done. And the sauce - oh the sauce!  Although no where near as spicy as I expected from Kung Pao, the flavors were deep and somewhat sweet with heavy notes of hoisin.  The tofu had been cubed and fried til crusty on the outside and served with green bell peppers and water chestnuts.  Deeeelish! This bowl of noodley goodness is the things that dreams are made of - well, mine anyway!  
Service was good (didn't have to wait too long for them to re-fill my water - which is just one of my tests for good service!).
The decor is great and modern.  But we waited awhile for the food we ordered.  We only ordered 2 dishes.  We ordered salt and pepper chicken and beef chow fun.  Both dishes were great.  
Dumplings - good for chinese delivery, but nothing to write home about
They have a lunch special for $4.99 and a dinner combo special for like $8.75.  3 dinner combos feed's my family of 6 with left overs!  Seriously its great food.
The food was pretty good- nothing stunning, but something worth its money.  I had the pineapple fried rice, which was very nice since I don't know of any other restaurant that makes that.  And actually, we were all mooching off of each others' dishes, so I can't remember everything I ate!  All I know is that I would go to Red 8 again- not too often, but if there's a small occasion to celebrate.
The wine list was ok too - started off with a malbec and then moved to pinot grigio with mains and both went well with all our dishes. So I wouldn't not come on the basis of the overall wheat base of the food but I would be aware that my options will be a tad more restricted than other places I've experienced before...
Shanghai Club has a nice vibe, a pleasant crowd and relatively healthy Chinese food.  We had Thai chicken curry and chicken Moo Schu.  Both dishes came with brown rice.  Both were laden with veggies.  They were freshly prepared, hot, and delicious.   With beer, the per tax total was $32.00.  I can't wait to go back and try more food.
The prices aren't that great either.  While the takeaway seems fairly standard, the sit in menu seems a tad bit too pricey.  This is rectified by the Happy Hour deal as mentioned previously.  2 courses for £9.50 isn't bad at all.  However, this deal only applies to a set menu of dishes marking the foundation of Chinese cuisine such as Lemon Chicken and Chow Mein. I can imagine that to the more experienced Chinese diner, these options would seem rather constricting. 
I consider the price is slightly on the higher end, but mostly due to that I can make most of the items myself at home. You can find good frozen dumplings and baozis from Asian groceries, and they are super easy to prepare. This probably explains that why such an authentic place draws fewer Asian crowd than I imagine--because we can make these stuff at home. 
Spring Rolls - Much like the crab puffs, crispy, but otherwise unremarkable.
Ching cho min cha. LOL
Altogether, the meal with two drinks came to about $35, which isn't bad considering the portion sizes. Much better than Panda Express value. Perhaps my favorite part of the meal are the complimentary banana desserts that they give you that are wrapped in wonton paper and coated in a crunchy caramel like sauce. SO good!
We just got our food here to go. This place is OK. They pack the shizzzles out of our food for what price we paid for. I'd come back here but there are other places I know I can still try. This place only has a few reviews and I thought I'd help out other yelpers before they come here.
Although the Hunan special chicken is good, it's not as tasty as it used to be.  Or, maybe my tastebuds became more picky ever since I lived in L.A.?  ;-P
- Egg Drop Soup
This place is clean, servers are friendly, food is good and prices fair.
I'd heard largely good things about Flo's and decided to take it in, myself.  Surprise, surprise...it's in a strip mall, but a quaint one at that.  The interior is sorta (sub)urban-chic.  It's a mix of upscale and low-brow with linen table cloths and throwaway paper napkins.  Cool enough for adults, yet casual enough if you're bringing the kids.  I was fortunate in that unlike some other Yelpers, I had no trouble finding a parking spot and the decibel level was comfortable.
the restaurant itself?  i love the unintentionally kitschy aspect of it.  the superfriendly staff have been there a long, long time, and have obviously decorated how they want to see it.  after ducking in there every couple months while going to school down the street, it started to feel like my second living room.
I live in north Phoenix cave creek area, I drive to there for dinner twice a week. Yes, more than 60 miles every time, totally worth it.
We came in here last night on our never ending quest to help out business in our neighborhood being affected by the light rail construction.   There were no other patrons in the restaurant when we walked in, and the entire staff was sitting at the tables watching TV.  Since they were clearly not busy, I thought "oh boy, I think we might actually get good service for a change".  Ha, I thought wrong.  
Food presented as large portions, but its a "smoke and mirrors" tactic. Mostly fillers and lacking in authentic flavor. Tastes like they took a wok and splashed the kitchen in there with an extreme amount of soy sauce without paying close attention to wok temp, and amount of the authentic spices, or lack thereof.
My business partner also concurred that this place rocks.  We both enjoyed ALL the food we had there, including some fantastic vegetable Lo Mein where the veggies were so fresh and tender-crisp (instead of soggy, nasty, overcooked vegetables like most Chinese Restaurants serve).  
Every single person (including the three-year old) was blown away by the taste of the food. I really can't say much more.
You know how they say you can tell how good a place is by whether the customers are the same ethnicity as the food? Well, it was a sea of Asian :)
I have been dining at C.E. for several years now and have always gotten the DELICIOUS honey tofu (ask for it extra crispy). 
Have always left feeling over full as the 3 courses is rather a lot of food.  The guy with the glasses is a bit of a hard case, often forgetting the orders and having to come back to check etc, but is very friendly.  The woman on the other hand seems rather sour.
*Wok-fried rice cakes - Little oval noodles (same texture as Chow Fun) in a savory light sauce with fresh, crunchy vegetables
We will definitely come back!
The Mexicans that served us were nice.  Nothing wrong with their service and they did everything they could to accommodate us.  We went with my mom who generously treated us.  But, my mom is very discriminatory and you could see the sour look on her Chinese face as she really didn't want to eat Chinese food made by Mexicans.
To top it off, the owners make you feel like family and I would equate it to a "Cheers" like Chinese restaurant. Go their a couple of times, introduce yourself, and everybody will in fact know your name.
Due to the event, we were seated in a side room. It was very drab and badly need of updating. The cement floors were cracked and the bathrooms were scary. The waitress was nice but neglected to ask us what we wanted to drink. When she brought the food, we had to ask for water. Also despite knowing we were sharing, she didn't bring us any extra plates. Annoying. One thing I forgot to add was when we first got there, we stood waiting in the lobby trying to figure out how to be seated. There was a sign with an arrow to the dining room on the right for the event, but it didn't specify to seat yourself. After seeing several employees at the register not ackowledge us, I finally asked what we should do. Then she told us to seat ourselves. 
Refreshingly not doused in grease, the food still lacks flavour. It is bang average, and whilst perfectly acceptable after a session in the pub, isn't going to be a revelation to your palate. Sometimes when I've had it, the noodles have been pretty hard too, which is never a good thing.
Lakeside Shellfish Bar
We walk in and there are a few tables to sit at, however, this is not a dine in joint. You must order at the counter, and unlike Panda Express, you cannot see your food before you order it. 
 They are very quick when you call in an order. I have never been kept waiting once, not once!! That's so great!
Unfortunately not to CA :(
Bitter Melon with beef-  the butter melon was sliced thin and the beef was also thinly sliced. Nice flavor and just the right amount if black bean sauce. I love bitter melon and it had to be al dente to be right and this was just about perfect. 
We ordered the egg roll appetizer.  They served it piping hot with to go packets of "duck sauce" and "hot mustard". I expect more from a place with hand pulled noodles. They should really take the time to make their own sauces. Which more or less was a foreshadowing of things to come. The rolls themselves were good but greasy.
Been getting food to go from here for over 3yrs. My wife usually tend to get the same items. Why fix something when it works.
My wife and I have come here multiple times and never have we been disappointed. 
Meh. We ordered quite the smorgasbord & I wasn't delighted with anything. My veggie roll was large but not very tasteful, same goes for my boyfriend's shrimp roll. The Crab Rangoon was lacking in any filling- I felt like I was biting into deep fried air! Our veggie moo shu was boring & had no egg in it? The wraps for the moo shu made me feel like I was eating paper. The bf ordered General Tso's chicken & said it was decent. I wouldn't order from this place again unless I had no other choices...
orange shrimp
Went there with 2 friends and the food was great and the service was superb.  My friend loved it so much that she is going to bring her Mom on her next visit.
The really bad: I also ordered fried wontons, 12 for about $3. When I ordered them the girl at the counter went back and forth with me about crab puffs versus wontons? I said WONTONS not CRAB PUFFS because I'm allergic to crab! Okay so I get home with my food and pull out the TINY wontons. Last time I checked wontons had meat wrapped up in them. These did not and I was really annoyed. I paid $3 for 12 plain fried noodles.Yeah...not good at all. 
As a local here in vegas, the best chinese food here is still KJ's kitchen on spring mtn rd.  It's also $1-2 cheaper, but way better food.
When I protested to the server, she passed me on to the owner who said this is what lai fun is like in the US.  I was outraged - how can you  use this as an excuse especially when the dish was advertised in Chinese only?  Obviously whoever could read it would know what it's supposed to be like.  You don't pass off fettucine for spaghetti just cuz you're in another country!
I ordered the Mushroom Chicken Noodle Soup ($13.95).  Oddly enough, no mushrooms were to be found (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA?select=T0-NanAljdtgnKdr4rwP7g).  There really wasn't much to brag about this soup.  The chicken was boneless and and the broth was a little on the bland side.  But I'm just glad that it did it's job in keeping my body hot when it was 32 degrees and snowing outside.
Excellent beef with Broccoli!  Will be back
I ordered delivery from them but the driver ever came. An hour after I ordered, i called to see if the driver was on his way, and of course I was promised the food was on the way already. Another half hour passed by and the food still didn't come. 
I had the food delivered took less than a hour not too bad,but the driver who got $5 bucks as a tip was not rude, but curt and didn't seem thankful. He called me from outside my. Apartment door asking me what my apt number was I told him and he said he was outside. I said I'll be right there and went to through on a pair of shorts and a tee all about 20 seconds and the doorbell starts going off. I open the door and he was in mid-dial calling me again... SERIOUSLY!!!!
Well, some dishes are good and some dishes are not so good.  Portions on the small side compared with ACE and Mekong Palace a mile north.  3 1/2 rounded up to 4.
The Hot and Sour soup. Fan!!!! I really liked the depth of the flavor, hearty with lots of mushrooms, and whatever else they put in it. It great way too start meal with nice cup of HOT soup. The salt and calamari this I lOved. Too be fair anything done salt and pepper style (no matter the protein) destroy. The seasoning was well done had nice little kick too it. Best part of it was nice chunks of calamari rather then  ring style that can easily get overcooked and dried out. The breaded was perfect,  It had nice golden brown color, crispy, calamari moist on the inside cooked perfect, and addicting appetizer. The entree this is were felt like just OK nothing really amazed me or wanted me too have seconds. The noodles were cooked spot on, as were the vegetables, and chicken. Just felt that lack identity came too flavor in the dish. I felt like eating plain noodles with saute chicken and vegetables. I understand base of the dish but still could put something in it give it life. 
The only two issues that I had were the eggrolls and fried shrimp. The fried shrimp was a little overcooked, and the eggrolls were very dense and pretty tasteless.
It's a cute shop, all those steam from the dumpling making make the windows of the restaurant front steam up like crazy!
Still very good. We've been busy trying out new places that we haven't been back, but now I'm asking why? It's still one of the best Chinese places out there, open late, service is decent enough, prices are cheaper than the competitors.  
thought we would try it we had a coupon from them for buy one get one 50% off,
Not the cleanest place in the world... and the the snow flake water cups make it feel like Christmas... But you will not care because the prices are good and the food hits the spot.
"Cool" decor. Good for you sake. Put in your mouth General Tso's.
Overall, the food was not too greasy and not too salty, but just enough to be authentic Chinese food.
don't judge this place by the quality of its lunch specials (although i understand why they need to have lunch specials for those on tight time schedules, they are a family owned place and the staff is always on the run taking orders, cooking and running the food back to you!) 
The best thing about this place is the decor, which is clean and nice, with a Hong Kong Junk boat design covering the ceiling from the bar into the dining room. The next best thing is the Piano interludes on weekend nights. The service is next, which is a little overly eager to remove your plate, and the last thing is the food. 
Combo's run around $5.25 - $6.25 for lunch.  Large dinner portions are about $7.25 - $9.50 - the interior is SMALL - three tables when I last counted.  So it's mainly a delivery or pick joint.  
 
Reasonable prices. Delicious food. Clean.
I have been to this location on 59th & Olive Avenues, many, many times.  Today was my last visit as the 4 women working ignored us, the 5 groups of people behind us got served before we did, customers even asked these women to serve us first as we were first in line they all responded that they didn't see us!  How ignorant can you be!  I am appalled as to the ignorance of employees & manager who never stepped in to see what the ordeal was!  I will post over every social media sight as to the rude & ignorance of these employees!
Fried Dumplings: Were very tasty, but the dough was VERY thick.  I felt my arteries closing while eating them.
BUT that being said, the store is in hilldale and I'm guessing rent isn't exactly cheap. So prices are justifiable but hard for me to stomach when their fares are cheap street eats while visiting Shanghai and Bejing. 
The service is great.  The owners and staff are all very friendly.  Also, there are a bunch of picture of the food on the wall which may help those who want to try new things, but are a bit hesitant about what they might get.  
We arrived at the restaurant at 8pm. 8.01pm we were seated, and given the wine menu at 8.02pm we had bottled water, and by 8.05 we had our wine, tasted and poured in both glasses!
Here's a few tips for getting the most out of China Chile. Don't do take out. Always get a soup, hot n sour is our favorite. Chicken Salad is special. They never miss on spring rolls and pot stickers. Honey walnut prawns get my luv one Jonesing to go there. Orange chicken and orange beef have not disappointed. Noodles have. Chow fun or chow mein should be on your order. They do shell fish superbly, especially scallops. Whole fish is a mixed bag some great, some not so. The pork chops and chashu are a bit dry for my taste. Special menus on the whole have been disappointing. It's boom or bust, but if they offer seared beef tenderloin take the risk. One night I'm raving to fiends about how good it is, at the same time a guy at an adjacent table is complaining to the manager about the very same dish. That's China Chile.
For the people who doesnt like spicy on their dish, you can always ask them to NOT to add spicy on the dish that you ordered. Or even certain vegetables you dont eat like my wife, she only likes certain veggies on her chow mein or lo mein. Hope this helps
I haphazardly found China Village on my way to a concert at the Rhythm Room. I wanted something in my stomach before starting my night of music and debauchery. Before even checking my trusty Yelp app, the restaurant caught my attention with its folksy outside décor. Its exterior resemblance to Chicago's China district convinced me that it would, at the very least, have the basics of (American style) Chinese cuisine mastered. So, ignoring the old idiom, 'never judge a book by its cover,' I parked my car and walked into what ended up being an antiquated social environment. 
I tried to order beef chow fun.  I knew it wasn't on the menu, but being that I've ordered it multiple times, I thought  I knew the ropes.  Or I thought I did.  I usually order it, they go in the back, talk to the chef and I get my beef chow fun.
I will continue ordering from them, but I'll change up my order next time until I hit a short list of "go-to" entrees. The first on that list is the orange chicken.
This place is ridiculously cheap-almost so much so that it feels like stealing when the check comes.  There's nothing fancy about Beijing Noodle Cafe but the food is all the fancy that you'll need. The dishes are large enough to share, so come with friends and have everyone order something different! Beijing Noodle Cafe is not to be overlooked and worth a quick scoot through a questionable parking lot.
We had War Wonton Soup to start, very flavorful. Not your typical bland broth with overcooked floaters. Yum. 
Entire family loves this place. incredible value great food !
I would eat here everyday during our stay in Vegas if I could but of course, the bf wouldn't allow it. He would always have reservations at 5-star restaurants. But this is my go-to place if I was given the choice.
Firecracker Chicken with Broccoli, $11.99 
Still Fantastic!
My favorite back then was Mango Chicken. It's still on the menu, but now my choices are more difficult because there are so many other equally tasty things from which to choose. My favorites now include a delightful curry chicken, anything with pan fried noodles, spring rolls, and hot and sour soup. 
If you want traditional Chinese fare at a very reasonable price, then Diamond's is your place. They have fresh whole lobster, crab and fish cooked in a ginger/onion or black bean sauce. It's ridiculously awesome. 
Having lived in China for a year, we found ourselves looking for a place recently with authentic Chinese cuisine.  A friend suggested Jade House and we were not disappointed.  We had printed out the "traditional" menu online and circled what we wanted to order.  The waitress was a bit confused why we didn't want to order off of the American menu which was kind of funny.  Everything we tried was quite tasty:  chicken corn soup, spicy eggplant, dried cooked green beans.  I would've liked the eggplant to be spicier, but I'm sure next time we can ask for it.  We also ordered pan fried noodles which were okay.  We ordered one of the Americanized Chinese chicken dishes for our son and it tasted just as you would expect.  So, if you are looking for traditional Chinese dishes, this is a great place to go.  I'm craving those green beans just writing this!
5. It was impossible to find a waitress to help us at any given time during the meal. 
Cons: 
The next entree was the garlic fried shrimp, it's heavy but so good. If there wasn't for the fact that tons more food was on its way, I would have broke my diet with this dish alone.
General Tso's Chicken
4) crab puffs = AGAIN worst I've ever had so plain and the cream cheese inside didn't have any flavor
The hard part about moving to a new city is finding restaurants to satisfy any cravings.  We got take out from House of Mei because of proximity and Yelp reviews, and we were not disappointed!  The food was fresh and not greasy like many Chinese restaurants.  We got the steamed dumplings, shrimp fried rice, mu shu pork, sizzling beef pepper steak and chicken with almond sauce.  The shrimp in the fried rice was a good size not the frozen little baby shrimp like other places.  The entrees were not too saucy, they were just right.  There were so many other entrees we wanted to try, can't wait to go back!
Came here at lunch time with family on a Sunday and the place was pretty empty (though I hear that it's super packed at night).  Lunch time prices are around half of dinner prices.  
Great chinese food on this side of town (my FIL lives on this side of Henderson), at reasonable prices. We've ordered takeout before, many times, and have dined here as well (some years now). So, I finally decided to write up my review.   
Pretty much always good food. Delivery... Dont get Angel Puffs. They arrive soggy and cold. Service is good but sometimes the person on the line is hard speaking of english. But... Yummy!
Make sure to get the lettuce wraps, they were awesome! Excellent service, our server was friendly, prompt, and courteous, we're giving her & the others that served us 2 thumbs up! The food did not disappoint us & the price was reasonable for the quality & presentation. 
Must try their noodle dishes next.
The food here was horrible! I ordered from the express menu. The kung pao chicken that I had was average. I just wish the chicken was seared more that way it could of had more color. The beef and broccoli was good. I would definitely not recommend their fried rice nor their noodles that come with this meal. The only good thing that I had here was there sweet and sour soup. Overall its not worth wasting your time and money at this establishment.
Anyway, this place was worth getting out of the house for on a rainy Sunday, and since its only a few blocks from our place, it was a nice excursion.
Great value and quality as always.
THIS is the place for someone who wants good chinese food, and wants to leave happy. 
I LOVE this place! It's waitstaff is super sweet and attentive! Their dinner combos are more than enough!! I always get the sesame chicken and it is always delish!
I want to say, I cannot remember in my years of eating in all sorts of restaurants and cafes all over - I cannot remember EVER complaining about a meal.  And, again this time, I sucked it up and ate my fish, trying to avoid the sauce - but, I really couldn't stand seeing my partner not eating anything after only a couple of bites.  The waiter was obviously not pleased, but he did allow him to reorder - pushing hard for the chow mien, which he ordered.  This dish was so salty that it was inedible.  (I had to later take him to an all night diner just so he didn't have to go to bed hungry).
Every time the BF and I come to Vegas, Noodle Asia is ALWAYS one of our stops. The restaurant is open late (until 3am, I believe), which is a huge plus after a long night of gambling or partying. The food is delicious, and I'm not talking about when you're drunk and any food you shove into your mouth tastes like heaven. 
The price is reasonable, the portions are good and if you need some new members to your extended family I'd recommend you stop by.
I tried Hakkasan Vegas for the first time last Friday (6/21/13) and was a bit underwhelmed. The entrance to the restaurant is somewhat odd as it is right next to the nightclub entrance - with hoards of people lined up waiting to party, it doesn't feel very welcoming as a restaurant. When we made it inside, the hostesses were really nice. We had arrived early so we had a few drinks at the bar while we waited.
Had the egg drop soup which was pretty standard.
Freakin' fabulous and fast Chinese take out, delivery and dine-in restaurant! What a lucky girl I am to have this place in my hood. The food is really good, they deliver really fast, and the prices are really reasonable.   They describe themselves as "New York Style" Chinese Cuisine and advertise that they use 100% vegetable oil.  $2 delivery fee, which I feel is fair.
I like their orange chicken, mildly spicey. And, I always get the most profound fortune cookies. Today's message " Working with children has a miraculous affect on your spirits." Ahhh.
My husband loves the Fu Chow Fried Rice and Shanghai Dumplings - he literally orders it EVERY time we patron Wendy's. He also LOVES the hot french style coffee but recently his new love is the ice cappuccino drink specially made for him. 
They offer sushi at this location, but I would not recommend it. The Chinese chicken salad is amazing, but I was not impressed with the hand rolls. 
what can I say this place has the worse Chinese food I have ever had the chicken had a funny taste and left a nasty after taste in your mouth the egg drop soup was bland as was the wonton soup. I gave 1 star only due to the egg rolls they were edible at least.  Go across the street there food is so much better!
Guy was really friendly (yelled "MICHAEL!" when I walked in. I must've been the only order?). He quickly put down his cigarette and finished my order nicotine free. 
The food is plentiful and there is always half left to take home!
House Special Friend Rice:  Very, very dry.  The rice could easily be separated into individual pieces.  The beef, chicken, and shrimp were skimpy.
the garlic chicken however, not so much. the chicken was passable (minus the bone/cartlidge thing i got) the veggies were pretty bad though.
Cheap chinese hole in the wall kind of place. That means it's just my kind of place.
I love this place. It has the best shrimp fried rice I've ever had. It also has very good egg flower soup that has chicken in it. Large portions, good prices, tasty food.
The egg drop soup is like no other I have ever had- thick, savory, and eggy, with small squares of tofu and red bell pepper. I am normally repulsed by anything with bell pepper, but this stuff is so delicious, I can totally overlook it. This time, I decided to try the won ton soup, and it, too, was awesome- savory and full of perfectly cooked won tons with little nuggets of pork inside, topped with green onions. Delicious. 
Ordered for delivery, bill was $10 more than what I ordered. When I asked the driver why it was $ 24 when I ordered 2 $6 lunch specials? The driver told me "because of gas"! Ummm no! You go now, I buy your food no more! Then the owner called and wanted to yell at me. Great customer service!
Total: ~$82
If you're a fan of spicy and heartier Chinese food, this place has you covered.  It really is excellent and I'd easily give it five stars if the service was a bit quicker, there were more drink options than soda, and there were a dessert or two to select from.
My friend loved it and would want to bring friends and families when they visit Vegas from Canada!
Beef & Broccoli was surprisingly good--but it wasn't mine, so boo hoo, moving on
the chicken in my dish had a few too many fatty pieces. Also, they were cut in different sizes. What I mean is some were sliced for stir-fry, some were cubed. I'm a stickler for consistency. 
Location is kinda...well..weird.. Its far from both parkings..you are techlincally in the middle between Mandalay and luxor so the walk if you (like me ) park at the main mandalay structure can be a little too long and confusing
Wow.. I am blown away by my meal here last night. The lamb noodle soup has me craving more. I am going for seconds tonight.
- We ordered both the maine lobster and dungeness crab, steamed with scallion broth. Of the two, I like the dungeness crab better!
Very disappointed,  ! Wongs Chicken tasted like it was a week old.  Egg fu young had no flavor.  The hot and sour soup was barely OK.
Highly recommended!
wow. i would def come back for a  nice dinner on the strip with great/fast/polite service and reasonable prices - score.
Chinese food!   We checked out this new Scottsdale restaurant and pub and it rocked.  Delicious food and a very nice menu.  I had the mongolian beef and it was more tender than any mongolian beef I have ever had anywhere. 
The outside is shady indeed, the inside is in fact shadier, and the food and service... you get the idea.  I ordered the beef and broccoli lunch which included fried rice - a safe bet at any Chinese place.  What I ended up with seemed like some sort of gelatinized beef fat... at least I hope.  If it wasn't fat, I have no clue what it was.  And the fried rice looked something like rice, but I don't even know how to describe what it tasted like.  Needless to say, I didn't take 3 bites of the plate before throwing it out.  And I kind of feel sick just thinking about it.
This is not a place to sit and eat unless you're looking for a fast meal. It's a great take-out place, I can't recommend it highly enough. 
-the mongolian beef tasted like donkey...I hate to say it but Panda Express is a 5 star restaurant compared to this shit
Very good but not that different from any other Panda..... But i love Panda Express so its easy for me to five 4 stars
Wendy might have snuck in a few addictive ingredients to keep clients like myself and the bf keep coming back for dinner almost every night!! My bf loves the steamed dumplings, short ribs, salt pepper shrimp and seafood lo mein. I happen to like the lo mein as well(add some sriracha for a little kick!) and their assorted mushrooms with bok choy hot pot! The only thing that left us disappointed was the dessert. We tried the Napoleon with some fresh fruits, and it was not good whatsoever. I didn't know what to think of it. It was flaky, light, bitter and sour at the same time. We also tried the red bean with mung bean drink and it was pretty standard. Good thing the food was good so it made up for the nasty taste I had in my mouth from that Napoleon
The first time we went, we were told that the tapioca pearls weren't ready yet (it was around 11 in the morning), and that it would be close to an hour. A little disappointing that they aren't made ahead of time, but considering that some pearls take almost two hours to make, it isn't too surprising. In fact, they do let you have yesterday's pearls if you want, or there's some yummy jelly options. But what convinced me to keep coming back here for their smoothies was that they use fresh fruits and not some substitute like powder or syrup. The prices are reasonable, and the mango smoothie is one of the best I've had and isn't overly sweet as well. Usually I get a large and it's gone by the time I get home :|
Not impressed. We won't be coming back.
I have been a repeat customer for a few years now after a friend recommended. Absolutely love this place. The chicken lo mein is yummy, and their delivery is quick and the food arrives hot. Also, the prices are amazing for the large amount of food they give you. Never had any issue with the employees. A definite favorite of mine.
Background: I lived in Beijing ten years ago, and I basically haven't eaten Chinese food since. I simply have not found any Chinese food worth eating in Madison or Milwaukee, and after a while I gave up looking. 
I love this place for casual Chinese food. We usually order lunch menu for to-go and nothing really disappoints me. They all taste good. However, their service is terrible. Everytime I visit here, a very unfriendly male waiter in his 50's takes my order. I was very unhappy when he didn't come to take my order for more than 5 minutes even the restaurant had only two customers.
You can't really expect too much out of anything at the university plaza, because food is catered towards students and they tend to focus on quantity, speed, and pricing that appeals to students as opposed to quality and service. 
1. $7.50 for a greasy plate of ginger chunks, rice, and egg is too much. Yelp advertises this as $ but it's really $$. We spent close to $40 for two of us. 
This place is awesome.  Huge amount of food for the price you pay.  We always go home with leftovers.  Lunch specials are pretty much the same as the dinner potion, just cheaper!
The epic soup?  Completely devoid of any and all flavor.  Even ramen and pho that has strong condiments at the table to flavor the soup to your liking has a strong flavor to begin with that is only complimented by the table fixings.  This was just... beyond me.  Super thick noodles and giant chunks of lamb, awesome.  Flavorless soup?  Bland?!  I was so just disappointed with all of this.  The lamb skewers were tiny for what I expected and slightly over-seasoned.  
The interior is dated, but that isn't as big of a problem as the boring food. 
After I made my order, the host served me some green tea as I was waiting for my food.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It didn't take too long before my food was ready which then I rushed home so my bf and I could eat.  The food was awesome.  Everything was as Yelp members said it would be and I would go back over and over again to try all the other food.  The meat and shrimp were tender and seasoned perfectly.  The Chinese broccoli had just enough and right amount of oyster sauce, and the rice was cooked perfectly.  
Overall, it's one of my favorite places to eat, anywhere.  And since I don't live in Scottsdale currently (coming back soon), it saddens me to see the locals where I live think the mediocre Chinese food they eat is any good. When I come for visits, I now bring my friends to China Wok with me and they finally understand how good Chinese food can be.
7. Shan Dong Marinated Pork
We also tried a desert cup which is a perfectly sized desert in a shot glass...both the choclate cake with rasberry sauce and the rasberry cheesecake were good..
     Steamed red cod live fish was HUGE. A whopping four pounds ($48/LB). The fish was steamed with soy sauce, green onions, and probably garlic and ginger. The flesh was flaky, sweet, and the sauce complemented the fish well. 
Menu: massive menu, a bit overwhelming.  Did have the server help with some suggestions to help us decide.  Cutting that in half would still yield a ton of tasty options.
Ive been here a few times, food is pretty good. I wanted to get a delivery today but the guy on the phone was obviously in his own world. I ask for fried rice and orange chicken to which he replied soup. I said no I want orange chicken with friend rice. He replied the lunch special, I said im not sure what your special is all I want is friend rice. He said what fried rice, the rice that comes with the chicken. I hung up. Seriously? Just take the fucking order moron. Is it that hard to understand FRIED RICE AND ORANGE CHICKEN!
Off to a slow start waiting 5-10 minutes for a waiter or menu but the service was great after that.  I was dining alone and the entrees are big enough for 2 to share, especially if you get appetizers.
-Parking is very convenient.
Lobster is $10 a pound, $1.12 more than HK Star. Across the board, everything is about the same or a couple of bucks more than HK Star, but nothing too terribly expensive. They also have a $5 and $6 lunch special menu like HK Star. 
I also got an order of pork fried-rice.  The pork was ok, but the rice was BRIGHT ORANGE and had no flavor. Since when is fried rice supposed to be orange?  Didn't have the bits of egg either. 
The Golden Egg Roll is convenient as it's right near where I live. For the food and the price, I have to say they offer a good value. However, it's not the most flavorful Chinese food I've had. But it's much better than Rice King. 
I say "almost greeted" because as she looked up with a  half-smile to acknowledge me, my attention was diverted by the appearance of who I'll assume was the designated order taker. She offered a similar warmth and was extremely efficient in taking my pre-considered menu choice. Good Service-Check. Good vibe-Check.
Me likey...
They forgot my spam musubi =( i guess i don't get one even though i payed for it..i got "put in the system") lets see if it get lost in the sea of lost...along with my chopsticks and spoon..lol i ordered soup, teriyaki bowl, and 2 musubi ..my girl loved her musubi.. all i got was soup... i would give this place a 4 if they would have gotten things right...
This place has the best fried rice ever . not too dry , just perfect, I've only eaten inside once, and the workers are very nice. I order take out from here all of the time and they have fast service.
I've never been disappointed with the food at Flo's. It's easily the best affordable Chinese food here and even rivals some of the best places in the Bay area. My personal favorite is the lemon pepper chicken, which is delicately tart. The kung pao is also pretty fantastic. No matter where you go on the menu, it's hard to go wrong here.
Overall experience was disappointing. For all of the awards that they've received that they display in the entrance, this experience was not good. Food was okay, probably one of the most bland general tsao's chicken I have ever had. And last but not least, the service was terrible. I had to wait 20 minutes for my second glass of water. If you are looking for a good Chinese restaurant, your best bet is to save a few dollars and get a better meal at Panda Express at the east town mall across the street.
I speak some chinese and lived in Beijing for a year. Of course the food is not as good as what you can get in China but they are trying hard and I'll keep going back. The people who work there are really nice too. My boyfriend who has never had authentic chinese food is really impressed with the flavor. Make sure to order off of the chinese menu. Try the eggplant or string beans and make sure to say you vegetarian if you want vegetarian. This is traditional chinese food so there is meat in the "vegetable" section which isn't stated on the menu.
I like that this is different from your usual chinese fare, and I'm looking forward to trying a few new things (probably not pork belly though).  This place is definitely worth a try.
Service is quick and friendly. Parking can be an issue, and the place fills up fast during weekday lunch hours.
  What I also enjoy about this Panda Express is that it shares a parking lot with Best Buy and Starbucks. 
So what's not to like? Oh, just the $13-20 prices for a plate of quality Chinese food you can purchase at any local Chinatown for $5-7.
Their noodle soup, the duck and bbq pork is delicious as well.  I've tried Mama Woo's Spicy noodles soup too and it was great!
Vegetable Fried Rice ($8.95) - I felt there could have been a little more flavor in this dish. The size was perfect especially if sharing, but the carrot and peas didn't really stand out flavor-wise. The rice was cooked just right though.
Very reasonable prices for a lot of food.  Lunch specials are typically around $5 and include drink or soup.  Like typical fast food Chinese places, they use an ubiquitous "brown sauce" base in most of their entrees which they add an extra ingredient here or there to make it a "Szechwan sauce" or "garlic sauce".  As for the quality, just OK.  I had an order of egg drop soup that was the most gelatinous soup I had ever seen.  When your plastic container of soup jiggles when you move it rather than sloshing around, and when your soup sticks to your spoon and after some effort, lazily drips down when you turn the spoon upside down, you know you've put too much thickener in your soup!  In addition, I had a fountain soda from here once instead of the soup, and it tasted pretty flat.  So, it's not the best Chinese food out there, but it's a good deal for what you get.
BUT THE WAIT TIME WAS INSANE!
Also not just the food is great but their deserts are delicious! Mango with white rice and cream is a must try!
Yan, the manager, is a very friendly person, who obviously cares about the restaurant.  He takes the product and the service very seriously.  I'm sure he's a big reason why this restaurant is so spot-on.
Food comes out super fast.  Ordered the curry noodles with bbq pork and shrimp, it was DELICIOUS! Portion size was good for $13 bucks. Also ordered a glass of chardonnay for $7. My friend got a beer and the crispy pan fried noodles.  Overall a great place for a quick bite that won't break your wallet.
My Husband and I went on a food hunt, We usually do the "what are you in the mood for, I don't know what are you in the mood for" dance, Well tonight we both wanted Chinese but wanted to try some where new. We have passed this place several times and decided to give them a try.
I look forward to eating here again and trying another item on the menu.  I hope this place sticks around and does well.  The food was great and the service was just as good.
Clean, modern design.  Stainless steel tables, color coordinated chairs, white table cloth & walls and black ceiling.
We tried China Chili for the first time this past Monday with my family, after hearing about it from friends and family for a long time.  The place did not disappoint.  It is clean, spacious, and nicer than some of the other Chinese food dives that we love to frequent.  The service was fast and attentive.  
Come here for authentic canton-style noodle soup, since it's the best in Madison. I was transported back to times in Chicago's Chinatown and business trips in Hong Kong. These are American serving sizes, so if you're a smaller person you could probably order to split between two people, and get a second, drier dish to nibble on or pack for home. 
Chinese broccoli, dan dan noodles, too many goodies to name!
This was my first time here due to the Yelp reviews I had Eric take us here.  I am in awe the different between fresh made noodles to just store bought.  As I write this I'm noshing on my left over shrimp chow mein from last night's meal.  It's sooooo good. The Lan Zhou Beef Noodle was so yummy with its spiciness.  Too bad they are so far from where I live.
Some of the food on the buffet is quite good. The Szechwan pork and barbecue pork stand out in my recollection. The fried rice is memorable for its blandness and frozen peas and carrots. Cabbage was apparently the only ingredient that they could find to stuff their egg rolls with.
Spare rib black bean sauce hot pot - I love those spare ribs at dim sum, but I just wanted a whole bowl full on rice. Finally a place with it in a entree size just for meeee!  
Came across this place because it is next door to the Little Caesars that we get our "Family Movie Night" pizza from. 
YES.
Outstanding!  
Delicious fresh and big portions what more could you ask for, everything we tried was great, Generals Tso chicken was crispy and not overly sauced, place was very clean and service was outstanding. We will be back to try more.
Walking in the establishment was pretty empty - the young man working the front of the house was beyond friendly and accommodating.
Now onto the food. We started with an order of spring rolls. I was starving and they were good. I really liked the spicy mustard sauce that was served with them.  I got a noodle dish - homemade noodles with eggplant - for lunch, how could I not when their specialty is home made noodles?! I was not disappointed - the noodles were delicious and the serving size was perfect.  
The quality of the food is the most important in any restaurant.  As far as shabu shabu goes, this is OK.  The beef is not USDA Prime but the seafood is very fresh (they should reconsider some of the seafood choices such as the cod since it breaks up into tiny flakes as it cooks).  The cooking broth is very simple and benefits greatly from cooking all of the ingredients.  Enjoy the noodles at the very end of your meal and you will not be disappointed.
China Grill was fantastic when I went, majorly due to the person i was with (wink)  anyway, back to what I ate and what I think about them =)
Based on the reviews and what the common thread running through the reviews was, it was NY chinese food, I was expecting something different. The owners may be from Flushing, but this food is not what I consider NYC chinese food. There are no ducks in the window, no feet in the soup, no pork buns. This is Queens, Little Neck, Massapequa strip mall chinese food. This is New Brunswick / South Plainfield, NJ chinese food. The only thing missing was the lighted picture board of the menu. It's good, it's not great. I have had better. In fact, I hate to complement anything from Wisconsin (dreadful place) but Tom's Red Pepper in Middleton, WI is actually a better version of what the other yelpers are describing as east coast chinese. The won-tons were stale. The sweet and sour sauce a bit thin. The chicken was cut rather small although it was white. I was disappointed to see it was not served with the traditional chunks of green pepper and pineapple. The fried rice was good, but very greasy and too much soy sauce. Chloe J said in her review that it had a distinctive flavor? There is nothing distinctive about onions, grease and soy sauce. The won-ton soup was slightly on the bland side. The food is okay and if someone was looking for adequate chinese, a cut above the heavily sugared and sauced up P F Chang's, I would recommend Red House. Could it be relocated to New Jersey and compete in that market? No. They lost their Flushing edge, they have been west too long.
Good food but WAY WAY over priced. Small on portions, big on price! Nice staff, old worn out/tired decor. If I want to spend lots of money there are NICE and updated restaurants in Scottsdale to choose from. Being located in Cave Creek/Carefree does not give license to overcharge their patrons. Likely won't be back.
Great little hole in the wall, they are always very friendly and the food is served FAST.  I loved the Snow Hill Chicken, and also a fan of the Cashew Chicken, both were very fresh with lots of good vegetables.  Good fried rice on the lunch special and the Hot & Sour Soup and the Eggrolls are delicious.  I like this place and eat here whenever I'm in the area.
I ordered a stir fry rice noodles, she was rude and the beef tasted weird,  I believe its spoiled or far from fresh. and the noodle was tasteless, trust me, I m not a picky person, 
Yes, and this chicken fried rice from Chop Chop Wok is pretty killer.  So good!  Theirs has a genuine 'fried' taste to it and I'm pretty sure the chicken is marinated.  Goes great with a side of kim chee and an ice cold beer.  Complete meal!
OK so my boyfriend and I went through the drivethru. First problem: they were out of cream cheese rangoons. I could have brushed that off with no problem if that was the only problem. My bill was $11.10. I had $10.10 in cash and I told them to put $1 on my debit card. The lady screwed up and put $10.10 on my card and $1 in cash. They then told me they were going to give me a refund and try again. That didn't happen. I've worked in fast food and refunds are very easy to do. They gave me a dollar back and then tried to tell me that they gave me a ten. The manager came up and showed me two receipts trying to say that she refunded me. When a refund is processed, the receipt says "refund" and all the amounts have minus signs. All they did was charge me twice! They finally gave me the $10 and we brought the food home. Terriyaki chicken was good. Chow neon was good. The orange chicken was spicy. SPICY! Panda express orange chicken isn't supposed to be spicy! The crispy shrimp was completely inedible. I will NOT be returning to this restaurant EVER AGAIN.
The cream cheese puffs were soggy, greasy and about as far from "puffy" as one could get. The chicken was white, but it was also fatty and grisly.
After walking around New York New York  and only seeing steak, pizza, and pasta, we were happy to find Chin Chin. Pineapple rice was delicious and the the sushi roll was fresh.  It was exactly what we were looking for.
I had dinner here before david copperfield. First impression is that I liked the ambiance. The service was 5 star. The food portions were fairly stingy and very expensive. I would rate the food a 7 out of 10. Nothing special. The bill was 240.00 for two people and we don't drink. we had soft drinks. so thats one appetizer,two entrees and fried rice and two desserts for 240??? I would say that speaks for itself. I think the portions could be bigger I also found the menu a bit on the limited side. But its all part of eating on the strip.
If your looking for a good take out place try this one. Especially if you are from the East Coast, so worth it.
My favorite dishes are there gyoza dumplings (they're huge), honey walnut shrip, spring rolls, and Beef Pepper Steak. I've noshed on other tasty delights and they've been really tasty. 
About the only issue I've had is that their combo meals state that they come with an egg roll, and we have yet to see one in the package.  But those combos are so reasonably priced, especially for the amount of food you get, that I've never thought to go back and complain about it.  Can't blame them too much if I haven't brought it up to them...
However, not finding good :Egg Foo Young made well anywhere else, I find I come back for more.
1 large order of chicken egg foo young($6.95)
Anyway, don't let that lady dissuade you from checking this place out. I'm a big fan of chicken curry and I've tried it at at least 10-15 places. This one is my favorite. I'm not sure what I love about it, the right amount of curry and spices, right choice of veggies(minus the mushrooms, thanks for listing the ingredients in the menu so I could delete those...saves me picking them out!) It's simple yet tasty. They deserve a 5 star due to the fact that I've tried so many other places and none have compared. Keep in mind I haven't tried anything else on the menu, sorry I can't review those. 
I got the Singapore noodles and for a $23+ meal it tasted bland and ordinary. the only way I was able to give it flavor was put loads of soy sauce and sriracha sauce on it. A good meal doesn't need any additives and a GREAT meal should do it for you already. really disappointed because the place looks nice.
I came here for dinner. The price was decent and the food's pretty good. I had chicken "lo mien", which I was surprised to see on the menu. This seems to serve more take-outs than sit-ins. I wouldn't bring a date here though, but for a quick bite, this place does it.
The verdict?  Not bad.  As expected, it was pretty bland, but it actually had a little texture.  The pork gave it some flavor, and the preserved egg was interesting.  I don't know if I'd order it again, but I'm glad I tried it once.
We had the chicken potsticker appetizer, the pork with mushrooms, a wonton soup, and a curry chicken with noodles. Food wasn't bad...but it wasn't great either. We were the only table in the restaurant, and the three staff members were sitting at another table watching something on an iPad. I felt a bit weird about interrupting them for an ice tea refill...so I sipped off my daughters drink. 
This place is a well hidden gem.  Ghoulishly scary looking upon approach, do not be deterred by the unlit parking lot and warehouse-looking setting.  We visited late (9 pm) on a Tuesday night, and had a great meal; Hot and Sour soup, BBQ pork fried rice, shrimp with snow peas, and Stewed Pork Rib.  ALL worth trying again, although their menu is so unique and varied, we'll want to make different choices on future visits to see what else they have to offer. There's a wide variety of over 100 entree, soup, and appetizer choices from Cantonese & Szechwan cuisines - stuff I don't see on other Chinese restaurant menus anywhere in The Valley.  Service was good, although the place was nearly empty, so I don't know what it's like if they're busy. Other reviewers' remarks about the lack of atmosphere are accurate, but that does not seem to affect the quality or flavor of the food. Yes, their Christmas tree is still up (it's May), the decor is sparse, the parking lot is dark, but the place seems reasonably clean (including the bathroom), the food is good, prices are reasonable, and they're nice people. They could stand to tidy the place up a bit, but go there for an authentic Chinese meal, not for the ambiance!
Really like their Chicken dishes and noodle. Will order it again. Price is very reasonable and fast delivery :)
Great selection of casual authentic Cantonese food. The service was a little slow during lunch hour, and the food was a-ok. Overall a welcome addition to Las Vegas, and I look forward to trying out the many choices, especially the HK style desserts!
Duck Two Ways - just wished there was more!
Deep Fried Flounder - A whole fish for just $5 on their lunch special! Can't get any better than that!
Calamari Salad: Shockingly, I feel like this was my favorite dish.  To be honest, there wasn't a lot of calamari in the salad but the calamari was definitely flavorful and delicious.  The salad itself was fresh and definitely not soggy.  The most amazing part was the dressing, it absolutely blew me away.  I don't know if I'll ever be able to get ranch or italian dressing down again!
So I decided to come try chop chop wok. This place was actually better than I anticipated. I ordered the mongolian beef. The beef was very flavorful and tad bit spicy. But spicy is always good in my book. The portion size for the price is good. The staff here is very nice and helpful in helping you decide if you have never been here before. I really didnt like that my mongolian beef had way to much onions and not much beef.  I give this place a solid 4 stars. I enjoyed my food but had to dig for my beef in a forest of onions and serrano peppers.
Not impressed, nothing special.
*Love the cream cheese wontons - and we always end up with a free order with delivery.
If you're looking for an easy, casual Chinese meal in Phoenix - I promise you this is one of your best bets.
All in all, this place was disgusting! The service was terrible, the food was terrible and the cleanliness of the place (or lack there of) was horrendous. I would never go back here. And avoid the lunch rush, because this is when it happened to me and I don't want anyone getting sick of this joints lack of cleanliness.
Didnt get a chance to try out any of the smoothies but i'm definately sure to come back and try a few more dishes this place offers.
All in all, we were very happy, and The Wife is insisting that we need to go back at least once a week to try more of their dishes.
China Village is wonderful, one of the few places I would take an out of towner to.  Always solid food and prices.  Have not been let down yet!  Go China Village!  Woohoo! As good as it gets!      
They introduce a lot of new dishes too, which I often get to try free thanks to Facebook. I really like their shrimp dishes and usually anything with "spicy" in the name is good to go. A recent stand out was the pepper chicken. 
Every once and a while I need a little Grand Dragon in my life!
 If you love eggplant they do a great job with the garlic eggplant dish. The geoduk clam is exceptional. If you have to ask....google it. Im sure you could find this gastropod online. It is briny, Sweet, oceanic and more tender than you might expect. Positively great!! The pea leaf is not on the menu and it is fantastic. The cold jellyfish is a must. 
Lately, I have seen some small local restaurants, that have only one person taking care of everything: answering the phone, taking take out orders, and acting as a server (bring out food, filling up drinks, etc.). I don't understand why they insist in offering service for dine-in. I wish they would opt out of that and let customers order at the register. That would make things so much easier and faster. In addition, customers wouldn't have to wait forever just for the menus to come out or to get a refill. Just an idea...
Overall the food was okay and the place is pretty clean and spacious.
The General Tso's was average. 
The house special won ton soup was pretty tasty and was loaded with a variety of fresh veggies, as well as chicken, pork, and shrimp pieces.  However, one key ingredient was missing - won tons!
This is a little family owned joint that is across the street from Spring Valley Hospital, in a neighborhood I lived in for a little while...but even though I moved, I go there for takeout sometimes. It's cute how the real Chinese restaurants feel the pressure to model themselves after Panda Express, with the steamtables, 2-item or 3 item with rice or chow mein type thing, and the uniforms complete with baseball caps...well, it's sad, in a way, but cute. I ignore all that crap and just order to-go as if they were just a little family Chinese restaurant, which of course they are. 
I love changs but Sean at the bar was too pushy and ruined the experience.
I ordered the Hot & Spicy Bean Curd.  It was ok...  I'm still annoyed by the fact that decently priced combo specials in AZ are few and far between.  When I asked to substitute the white rice for fried rice, they told me I would have to make a side-order.  What is up with that out here?  Can't you just charge me extra? I KNOW for a fact that you have a big VAT of fried rice sitting in the back...Don't front like you make it fresh per order.  Anyway, I decided on the rice bowl size.  The meal was fine, just uneventful and a really small portion for almost $7.  Next...
absolutely vile disgusting, not dog worthy crap.
The location
I am going to go back to SIng High because it has that older Chinese restaurant feel i like so much. I only hope they improve the next time i am there, so I can give them the five stars iI think they deserve.
c.  Spring Bean with Chicken - Love the flavor of the black bean mixed with this dish.  The spring beans are cooked to perfection and the chicken is flavorful and tender.
lamb is highly seasoned, very spicy. There's a hint of game typical of lamb that you can notice, but only if you taste for it.
Glad I paid $10 for a meal that probably cost then a quarter. First and LAST time eating at Pumi Express!
4, after all these issues the other person I was with found hair in her orange chicken (GROSS) + her glass looked like it had NOT BEEN CLEANED in years!!!!!!!!!!!!. 
All three of us are Asian, so I don't think there was any unpleasantries due to race.
Okay chinese food found in venetian hotel.  Order the beef lo-mein, pork and special preserved egg congee, pot stickers, cantonese style fried rice, szechwan beef noodle soup.  Prices are pretty pricy for asian food but what do you expected if ordering food from hotel, everything is priced up.  
Lot's of atmosphere but just average food. I need to face the fact that the only place to find good Chinese is in NYC and San Francisco. 
Usually when I come to Vegas and want Chinese food, I hit up the Rio because I love theirs.  However, my dad told me Noodle Exchange in Gold Coast was really good and it was better than Rio's.
Tried this place yesterday and it was great .... I had a nice lengthy review going,  but it got deleted... grrr
Was disappointed after reading so many good reviews. 
We are full, happy and need a nap!
I have been ordering food from Chopstick Express every week since I first tried it out.  The food is not oily or bland, but as good as I get when I go out to a nice restaurant.  I usually get the food delivered to my house, but once in a while I eat at the restaurant.  There are not too many tables since the square footage won't allow for it, but the food doesn't take long to get to the table.  The facility is clean and the staff friendly.  I am so happy that I found this place.  I love their beef chow mein and their honey dipped chicken.  Think I will order some of their food right now!
So we get up there and find out that after we came in that the health department came and shut them down while we were in there so that's why there was no dessert.  The violation was something about food, I think it was pertaining to storage and preparing and it said right on the violation that they had been warned before.
This bi-coastal was skeptical about finding good Chinese food in Madison. Authentic Sichuan?? Named Ichiban??
My mom ordered the Kung Pao Triple. Shrimp, chicken, beeF, it sounded good but when it came it didnt look as appealing as it sounded on the menu. My mom enjoyed it. If we had thought about it we should have went with one of the FAMILY DINNERS... they have 3 options.. NXT TIME WE KNOW! our total was almost $40 for the 3 of us... and this is a mom and pop type place.. doesnt feel like a chain eventhough there are 2 in town. I think the family dinners sound like a better bargain considering it so easy to rack up a bigger bill than if you just ordere dthe Family dinner option and it has many things to try. 
I've only ordered lunch specials, so I've paid no more than $7 here ever.  Ordered three times so far.  They have won 2 times out of 3.  I'll tell you about their only loss.
The crunchy things they'll give you if you ask--those are good.
Indeed I would say that this restaurant has become my favorite restaurant in all of Vegas when both cost and flavor are taken into consideration.  Don't go here if you don't like spicy food.  Don't go here for a romantic dinner for two.  This restaurant is like other authentic Chinese restaurants in being very utilitarian and non-fancy.  Go here if you like really spicy Chinese food that is delicious.
Ill give Wendy's 3.5 for now... I want to try all of the appetizers! 
Who the hell cares if it's in an old warehouse?! This young entrepreneur (who my husband and I had the blessing of being able to speak with as we dined all alone before the dinner rush) is a force of nature who knows good food and great service. 
Though, for some reason, there were no fortune cookies. C'mon Ichiban, you need to get with the game here.
Since the offspring (Golden China II on Rancho) of this restaurant is so new that it's not even on Yelp yet, I will sing my praises here - same menu, same tastes, same hospitality, same delivery times - and all of them OUTSTANDING.  Their dishes (and I've had many) have never disappointed me.  They have always tasted authentic and tasty.  I even like the fact that their egg rolls are actually lumpia w/o the meat. (this was a nice surprise - as I don't normally eat egg rolls with their crispy thick bumpy wrap).  The portion sizes are unfreakinbeleiveably HUGE!  The leftovers truly do last me 3 days of lunch/dinner.  I've had both delivery and pick up and they average 20 min. delivery (lunch hour rush) and 10 min pickup - outstanding!
carving station that includes thick carved bacon - how great is that!
first, they did not have any breakfast to order which did not match with their Ads outside. after we sat down, we waited more than half an hour for all dishes but in the end, they just cancel our order and let us go becayse there are more people waiting outside.
I also ordered vegetable egg fu yung.  I was told it is vegetarian.  At first I wasn't thrilled with it but each bite grew on me more.  I liked it.  However, all the food was so greasy and unhealthy that I wouldn't choose to eat it again.
There was this one poor older Asian lady (totally reminded me of my mom because of her looks), was the waitress for all 10 tables to herself! Running food, taking orders, answering the phone, it was insane. I saw that another slightly younger lady was helping her out a little, but I almost felt bad for the older lady. Despite the chaos, she still took the time to answer my annoying questions about the food.
Good food, nice attitude, tasty
New Asian Kitchen is our new fave!
the bill equaled to over $500. if you want more food for 1/10th of the price, head down to chinatown to either food express or PJ'S kitchen. 
As good as it gets for Chinese food in Surprise right now.
Flo's lunch deal is good bargain. The dishes are usually around 7$ and come with a salad with a tasty dressing and bowl of won tons with a nice orange dipping sauce. I usually order the Teriyaki bowl and they now have the option of white or brown rice. It is enough food that I can only eat half of it and bring the rest home for dinner. I enjoy the ultra quick water refills as well. You can't beat the lunch deal I recommend it highly! Only complaint is that it can get a bit noisy when it's packed and it's usually packed!
The owner/chef is always proud of his cooking skill. He is too arrogant like a frog lives inside the well but has never been the outside world.
The sauce for the fried dumplings is a flavor extravaganza- which is exactly what I want it to be: salty, tangy, and SWEET. In my experience, most places miss the sweet component of the dumpling sauce, which I feel is a mistake.
Been twice now, owner and counter service very friendly.  The food is ok when you have a need for Chinese American food fix.  Deep fried items are REALLY deep fried... small-ish crunchy bits of chicken kind of thing.
I would say though, we were seated quickly and the service was good. Overall, good service experience, but I'm not sure I'd proactively seek this place out again.  Oh, and our meal didn't come with a fortune cookie:-(
The location is a bit far away from my school but still the food is good enough for me to drive down there;) love the eggs n chicken wing!!!!
THE FOOD - oh my god. The food. If everything else in this place was sub-par,the food would still get them a 5-star rating in my book. From their starters to the custom Hakkasan cocktails they serve,everything is one of a kind. Vegetarian and gluten-free options are available on the menu as well. 
Food overall is good, but can definitely be HIT or MISS. Pretty sure I got food poisoning once from the Chicken and Broccoli, so I just don't order it anymore. LOVE the spring rolls and fried rice. LARGE PORTIONS! Delivery can take a LONG time, so I'd pick it up if possible. The people working the counter are usually surly, but I probably would be to if I worked there.
Drinks were unique and delicious, but like everything in Vegas, wildly overpriced.  The food was not memorable at all. As we were eating, we agreed that the high ratings must come from people who enjoyed the atmosphere, which was nice.  We tried 5 or 6 dishes, including the famous duck salad. None of them were worth repeating. 
The szechuan had a picture of a chili pepper next to, implying it was hot.  Well, it wasn't.  Not even a little.  The flavor wasn't bad.  But nothing special.  And not spicy.  The decor and ambience was divey.  Very low class.  But seemed clean enough.
Disgusting, boring, blah food. With tip and all I dropped $40 on Lotus tonight and I wish I had went to Von's and picked up something from the frozen food section instead. It's hard to mess up Kung Pao chicken but Lotus found a way to crank out the most boring, uninspired Kung Pao I've had in a long time. 
This one knocked me on my butt.
I was recovering from a flu/food-poisoning, and as I was on the mend -- soup, particularly noodle soup, is what this non-medical professional prescribed to self.
this is a very good and authentic cantonese seafood restaurant in las vegas.  no reservations are taken and it can get extremely crowded during weekend dinner hour.  
- Beef fried rice, no peas, no carrots.  I swear I could eat a whole order by myself, but my thighs would hate me in the morning.  
Another one of my long standing lunch take out places.  Also another place I have never been to myself.  Probably have been eating from here once a month for 6-8 years.  A few years back they were closed for almost a year after a fire.
Their Peking duck was really juicy and the skin was very crispy. Everyone loved that.
tangsooyook - sweet and sour pork. very hot and freshly made and the sauce is to die for!
Initially I thought this place was really good because I was ravenous when I came for a late night dinner here. However, now that I think about it, it was just alright. There's only so much you can expect from a Chinese fusion place and at least the waiters warned us that it wouldn't be authentic. Fun environment and good drinks. Just don't come here expecting a real Chinese meal.
Stopped by on a Saturday afternoon to grab a quick lunch. Got the lunch special for around $5. Not too bad for a large portion of orange chicken with plain chow mein and fried rice. The food was good, but I wouldn't get the fried rice again. It was bland and dry. Also got a Thai Ice Tea with boba. The boba had a great consistency just the right amount of chewiness :) will be back for sure.
I've only been there about 3 times so far. I had their dim sum (8 kinds, $2 each I believe), which is not  great.  But my favorite is #33 House Special Fried Rice. It's fried rice with spicy garlic and seafood. It is so good!
My favorite dish so far is the sesame noodle kick, which is a simple sesame, garlic, and ginger noodle dish with diced scallions and sesame seeds on top. It has so much flavor that I don't even miss the meat (and I don't typically order vegetarian dishes). The taco-style bao with pork was also very tasty, although the pork seemed a wee bit overcooked; next time I'll try the chicken. I loved the white fluffiness and heartiness of the bao itself, though. If you're feeling under the weather, do your stomach a favor and try their chicken noodle soup. With fresh noodles, rotisserie chicken, greens, and a nice hearty broth, it's a great comfort dish. 
Kung Pao Chicken and Shrimp - Tasty, spicy, excellent quality.
Nice little mom and pop. Good price, good food. I would say the food is better than average for Chinese in this part of town. I will definitely be going back. Lunch menu comes with soup and salad to start and an egg roll and cheese ragoon with the meal. So if you are looking for "Panda" there is one across the street, but I prefer the mom and pop.
Wo Fat is the bomb! Had beef chow fun and baked salted pork chops, Great flavor, huge portions.First time there, read previous reviews on yelp, most all reviews are very good.I will definitely be going back for more of GREAT FOOD!!!!!!
Prices are great and everything I have tried is very well done.
Spicy Shrimp in Shell aka Salt & Pepper Shrimp. These were what you would expect, just not spicy at all. Good version of this dish. 
This is one of the Panda Express restaurants that I patronize in the Vegas fast food landscape. Four stars because I am a fan of Panda Express. This location lives up to their name.
Other meals with friends have been decent, but not a good as Gourmet House of Hong Kong-which has its own brand of dive, but at least there I never had to fight a cockroach for my meal...
The desserts were decidedly not Asian, despite making a dessert spring roll. We tried the creme brulee because I'm a sucker for it. A little bit grainy IMO but it had a good flavor. 
Reasonably priced too.
However, The food just wasn't that good. The pork and  chicken lo mein was very greasy and tasteless. The  vegetables were overcooked and soggy. The egg roll was cooked nicely, but just didn't have a good flavor.  The same could be said about the won tons and crab puffs.   
- The pork & shrimp dumpling had a LOT of green onions (-2 points)
Def one of the better if  not my best of the East Valley. The owners are very welcoming and its a nice quiet place. I'm a huge fan of fried rice and sweet and sour and they do both very well. I love the chips in the beginning and who doesn't love ending a meal with a fried banana delicious bite!! MMmmmmm Enjoy
This place is great, and will change your idea of what Chinese food can be.  
Really great noodles. My favorite are the wide flat noodles (labeled "D" on their menu) with beef in the XO sauce. They're thick and pleasantly chewy. And they're hilariously long. One very generous serving might contain only 2-3 noodles, each a several feet long.
Woo's offers a daily happy hour that starts at 3pm, which gets you drink discounts and a well priced small plates menu. Offerings such as plump and juicy Pan Fried Pork Dumplings ($4) and a plate full of fork tender, lightly fried Salt and Pepper Calamari ($5.25) are stand outs. If you pair these with a carafe of hot Sake ($4), happy hour could be a meal in of itself.
I ordered beef lo mein, BBQ spare ribs, and Hot and crispy beef- all very delicious! http://www.yelp.com/biz_user_photos/sYDc1TENwCKLHvprBa5rLw  The noodles were prepared well, not greasy, and the pieces of beef were lean and not sinewy at all; the ribs had a pleasing chew and were tasty, yet not overly-seasoned, nor sloppy/sticky with sauce; and the hot and crispy beef delivered on the crispy (yes!), without being greasy, had slight salty and sweet flavors to it, and the chili oil indeed added a spicy kick, even though the meat was flavorful without it.  (Enjoyed the steamed, yet crispy broccoli that accompanied this entree!)  Thank goodness the lo mein paired well with all the meats, since I am not able to eat rice without risking allergic reactions.
A lot of food for the money.  Their hot and sour soup is pretty good.  They offer a lot of variety and you definitely get more than your fair share.  Try them out.
Looks like it is time to find  new Chinese restaurant.
Our last visit was epic!  We ordered A LOAD of food.
By the way, their customer service is excellent and their restaurant is very clean. And they do take credit cards.
My boyfriend and I skipped the restaurant scene for Valentine's day and decided to order carry-out later on in the night. I have heard good things about this place but was surprised to see such negative reviews on Yelp. It seems, though, that people review based on the most amazing Chinese they've ever had and tend to get snobbish about it... I love Chinese food but I am certainly not an expert on places in the area so we decided to give this place a try anyway. I'm glad we did. 
This is really a one and a half star for it does not warrant the full one star.
A rather unlikely location for "new" Asian fast food (in Sun Lakes??), but Asian Grill is a real find. Wonderful lettuce wraps and probably the best hot and sour soup we've found in the Valley.
--Lobster soup with tofu and Chinese yellow chive was probably the worst soup dish ever.  for the price we paid (it was like high 20s) it was a small little bowl that barely had any lobster.  What happened to family style dishes?
 The service was nice, they really tried to please everyone. The eggplant was awesome, and the dishes were all hot and tasty.
Food:
A craving for sesame chicken had been creeping in for a while, so that was what both of us ended up ordering. She got the special with soup and a different side, I got the plate with rice only.
It's not your typical Chinese food restaurant but the great thing is that they have congee with Chinese donut..it's bomb and not only that they have shaved ice dessert they still do some of your typical Hong Kong dishes but a lot is different
Stir fry can be a little greasy but oh MAN. There is like... a smoke flavor? I'm not sure what it is. But its delicious. Pad Thai is good. 
I'm from New York I have been out here 7 years and I have been looking for good Chinese food and it has been very hit and miss. I just moved across the street from this place and figured I'd give it a try. I kept it very simple, I ordered the barbecue spare ribs which a very big in New York. And I ordered a small chicken broccoli to go. The ribs with just shy of being good , they were just okay. I think they were little over cooked but the flavor was very good. The chicken broccoli was just a little better than okay. Did remind me of being back home in New York. The people were nice for the short time I spent in the restaurant. But what I really like is that I was able to get pint size order of chicken broccoli. I usually just order for myself and getting the quart I tend to eat too much, and if the food is really good who wouldn't. Next time I order I will post another review. Stay tuned.
Aside from the usual Americanized-Chinese fare, this place shines in what it has to offer on it's "Chinese" menu.  The only place I know that has the ShanDong Chinese/Korean favorite, Ja jang myun.  If it adds to it's credibility at all, both my Chinese AND Korean friends talk highly of the ja jang myun here.  I've had it myself and I thought it was pretty good (although I hadn't really tried it any where else so it's really hard to gauge against anything else).  So if you're sick of the usual sichuan, cantonese, *insert chinese province here*, then give Chef Chiang's a shot.
Oh they also have a drive-through == awesome.
I've been coming here for about 2 years! Their shrimp fried rice is awesome! It is located right next to my work, so it is very convienant for me. Love the service here! Very fast and friendly! Their lunch menu is also cheap and delicious!
But must admit, it wasn't greasy. Nice, clean flavors. 
just ok, i usually feel like crap after eating here, but they deliver, and you always get a ton of food.
Driving back to my parents after spending the day in Sedona, we were all very hungry AND wanted to splurge for some tasty Chinese food.
All I can say is...$2.99 special for an order of chicken fried rice!  Deal!
Please stop by and try it for tasty, affordable and a culinary delight.
The food was delicious and the service outstanding. The owner was extremely hospitable, doing everything possible to accommodate our large party and explaining all of the options available in both Chinese and English for our mixed party. 
This place has good food and friendly service but hardly any business. I was there on a weekday at 7 pm and I was the only person there. Not sure if that's do to panda express being  next door.
This place definitely has some authentic and delicious Chinese food.  It was great to see that the majority of the workers speak Chinese and that the menu is in both Chinese and English.  The service is superb and I love the little box of pineapple cake/ tea that they offer you with the check.  So why only three stars?  The place obviously has a very Americanized menu with the typical Kung pao chicken and Mongolian beef, and everything else you'd expect to see at pf changs.  I was not impressed with the overpriced duck for 39 and could not believe Peking duck would be 75?!  A table next to ours ordered it and it looked great and I loved the table side prepping and serving but am still dumbfounded.  The duck had a little too much fat for my liking but the food overall is very well done.  I LOVED my drink that had a kick of chili in it, long life something or other?  Anyways, good place if you are craving authentic Chinese food but expect to pay the typical Vegas prices!

My boyfriend and I have been here numerous times and have yet to be disappointed. I always get the teriyaki chicken which is great every time. The sauce has a wonderful flavor to it. They have really awesome lunch prices.
The food is always delivered very quickly (I order through eat24hours.com) and is always 100% correct, complete, and hot/warm.  The food is great quality for a cheaper Chinese restaurant.  There's no gross feeling after eating the food like with many similar restaurants (e.g. mall food).  I would recommend it!
I feel bad this place was dead for lunch. I hate to see place with great food not busy.
The Kung Pao... Again, a very good dish. If there was a complaint, it was that it was a tad heavy on the zucchini in the dish, which was just a tad overcooked. It changed the texture in the dish in an obvious way.
I've been getting food from Chai Tip's for several years.   They delivered to the hospital the night my son was born and their delivery driver has become a regular at our house.   When given a substandard orange chicken (we ate it all anyways)  we called a week later and were given a free entree.   The family is great and we have no complaints.   While not high cuisine we really like the place.  We recommend it highly.
Food came within 15 minutes and the server entertainingly showed us how to eat the spider prawns.  He came back within 5 minutes to check up on us to see if we were doing ok and enjoying the spider prawns.  The rest of the food followed promptly and was served by our server along with another.  Everything was delicious.  I have to say that most Chinese restaurants I've been to have to overtly salty, but I thought this place was perfect and I did not feel the need to have to drink water like a desert camel.  The honey walnut prawns were AMAZING.  A beautiful presentation also with blackberries, raspberries, and pineapple.  I could eat that all day.  The lobster fried rice was good and not too dry or salty, while the chicken was moist and flavorful.  Again within 15 minutes our server came back and asked how I dinner was and refilled our drinks.  We ate, and I was pretty darn full, granted we did order 4 dishes for the two of us though.  They came and cleared our dishes promptly and offered coffee for our dessert.
great service! The noodles are hand pulled. I would recommend general tso's chicken also of you aren't into eating noodles. Quality is great, service
Pork fried rice - What pork fried rice? What we got was 3 containers of brown rice The  Sesame Chicken  platter  was supposed to have pork fired rice which was not to be found in the bag.  But there were many containers of the gummy yet tough how does that happen brown rice.  Even I can cook brown rice better.
Overall the service was great, the place was clean and the food was tasteful.  I recommend.
This place sucks
Beef & Broccoli, Chicken with hot garlic sauce and their wonton soup is fantastic!
I think I'll go there now!
Poor quality food, not impressed. Sesame chicken overcooked, egg rolls okay, rangoons good, barbecue chicken overcooked, steak on a stick too chewy, chefs special just okay. Will not be returning sadly. Service was poor. Clean I guess but below average food.
now if only they had crushed ice.....
Tried for first time today.went for lunch, had salt and pepper pork chops and Mongolian beef.salt and pepper pork chops were very good because mostly all meat pieces maybe needed a little more salt but very good, Mongolian beef very good.Very good price for lunch special.highly recommend HK Star
The fruit, has been saved.  Point: Hsin.
* Wheat gluten (mian jin) and mushroom dish for our veggie friend: the mian jin was funky--way too spongy and slimy inside.
The best Chinese food I've had in Scottsdale.  Delicious!
I just have to give this place five stars, even if there are some minor complaints I could have. It's stellar, the food is cheap and fresh, the owners are absolute sweethearts, and they deliver locally!
After a long morning working at an event at the Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs Resort (where, consequently, I had my wedding reception), my friend/colleague and I were exhausted and ravenous. I was fairly sure there was a Chinese restaurant nearby, so Heather hopped on her iPhone and found Bamboo House. 
Overall
My boyfriend had the Frek En Good Sushi Roll and loved it. The seafood soup (with squid, etc. was another of his favorites. The mango/avocado sushi roll was great too as a vegetarian option.
China One is a good restaurant to grab a tasty fast meal. They wok their food fresh to order and we have always enjoyed both delivery and dining at the restaurant. I would recommend China One.
Third, they gave me the wrong change. I have to ask to get my money back.
good stuff I've finally found in New York style Chinese restaurant....that knows how to cook
This place has been here for decades for a reason;  good food, good service, good price.  Classic old school Chinese, family run restaurant.  Lunch specials are superb and leave little left to be desired. Winning.
The only thing I don't like is that the booth seats are soft and lumpy.  If you have back issues, you might want to sit at a table.
Location:  Caesars Palace
I wouldn't recommend this place.
My disappointments have come when I venture away from the lo mein.  The sesame chicken was just weird, I had to just throw it away, I was too scared to eat it.  The Mongolian pork was actually pretty tasty, but the ratio of green onions to pork was like 3:1, so I felt like I had been ripped off.  Last time I decided to try the orange beef; the beef was surprisingly tender but it had no flavor, it just tasted like beef, the orange sauce was completely lacking and I was sorely disappointed.
BY THE WAY, this place is real NY style Chinese; if you order chow mein (like our friend Nicole H. here) you will get no noodles. If noodles are included in the dish you want, read the menu, and order lo mein.
Ling and Louie's is a nice retreat from all the madness one might expect from an Indian Casino and its trailer-trash, octogenarian patrons. 
They do have wonderful service and generous portions, but that has never been a redeeming feature for restaurants.
In a rush but don't want to go to a fast food restaurant? Budget is tight? Then this is the place! Price to beat! Food is tasty and portions are large. Quick service and friendly staff. We come here mostly after midnight because the place can be packed during the day. The place could use some major renovations, though. But overall, I like it!
and the wait for our food was excruciating. I was hungry to begin with when I walked in the restaurant but it took good 40 minutes for our food to hit the table... 40 minutes during lunch when there are not that many people in the restaurant? the food wasn't even that great. I got sesame chicken lunch bowl and although I liked the fact that it had a lot of vegetables, it was too salty. In fact, everything we ordered was a little bit too salty, from soup to our entrees. Maybe it's the kitchen at this location? But I'm not going back to this one if I were to go to P.F.Chang's again. 
I liked the service. I mean really, I never go to a Chinese restaurant expecting good service. I just look forward to the food. But the lady gave us her recommendations. We were hesitant on the fish dish (bc we weren't sure if it'd be too spicy), and she told us to get the lunch portion vs the dinner since it was smaller and if we didn't like it, we wouldn't have as much. That was cool. 
              Chicken Fried Rice- FABULOUS!
The portions are pretty good, so if you eat family style don't over order.  One dish per person is plenty.  
Why is it that each and every chinese restaurant I walked into has bad decor? Do they all use the same interior designer?
I went here because I heard they were the original owners of Eba cafe which had these awesome milk tea drinks, and back then that was what they were known for but this time apart from the drinks their menu now has an extensive selection of Taiwanese/Chinese foods. 
Salty squid calamari - perfectly battered and chewy. 4 stars.
Right before I ate the food I was going to give this business 1 star....here's my story.
We will be back!
My first time eating bitter melon...it's bitter LOL. The pork ribs were good but tiny.  I'm not holding the bitter melon against the dish, because it is probably made well for what it is...just for the people that aren't familiar with it like me, be prepared to most likely not enjoy it.
It is located at the NE corner of W. Flamingo and S. Jones.  The restaurant has a few simple tables and chairs for customers dining in or waiting for their to-go orders. They also do lunch deliveries within the vicinity with a minimum order of $15.  It is opened daily pretty much from around 11amto 10:30pm.
I used to go here years ago with my family. I remembered it being good so I convinced my husband to go with me today.A-mazing! Better than I remember!   We shared puu puu platter.  That was just okay, nothing special.  Egg roll didn't have much flavor so I used some sauce.  But my dish?   Perfect!  I had Mongolian beef and it was just what I wanted.  Saucy, lots of green and white onions, but still had plenty of beef.  Hubby had mu shu pork.   Four generously stuffed Chinese creeps with their sauce.  He doesn't even like Chinese food and he liked this!  We ate an appetizer, two meals, plus two to-go boxes of left over for $30.   Great price for great food.  I will be back soon!
I have to say that I was a bit worried when I drove up. The place is a complete hole in the wall. It just looks really bad but I looked in the windows as we drive by and my partner and I gathered up the courage to go in. Once I was in I was committed even though the inside was just as bad as the outside. I came cause I read the reviews and wanted to give it shot. We walked to the register area and the lady was really friendly asked for our order and even had the patience to make some suggestions. She made us feel welcome. 
We prefer their food to Panda Express and the Grand China which is on the other side of Durango (and Warm Springs). I hear that the Henderson location is a lot better. We may have to take a trip there one day to see if it's true.
The only negative is the price but again.... You're in scottsdale
We heard of the XLBs here from Tony's review, but alas they had none. We've heard from other friends of them not having any so perhaps it's something they make only a certain time, so calling may be a good idea. 
I'm about a 3.5 food wise, but I will round up since there were a couple of solid dishes here.
I really wish I had known that the "taco bao" wasn't actually some fusion attempt at putting cheese and ground meat into a steamed bun, but instead what sounds like a delicious slice of pork belly.  
I have been here quite a few times since they opened. The past few times i went, I thought that I must've gotten them on a not so good day but now I'm realizing that the quality has gone down from all the other reviews I'm reading.  :-(  This is very disappointing. I was looking forward to have a decent American Chinese restaurant in the neighborhood.  The food when they first opened was top notch.  Well seasoned and well prepared but now the past few times I've gotten them, the food was still hot but there was no seasoning and the noodles and meat were overcooked.  I hope that they fix whatever was changed back to what it was when they first opened.
The man behind the counter is so warm and friendly that I'd find myself frequenting this place just because I wanted to see his business succeed. And from the looks of it, he's doing pretty well. A serious congratulations to the owners is in order for taking a cuisine that has been bastardized a million times over in America, and making it into something refreshing (both the idea and the food itself), simple, and unique.
This is my family's all time favorite Chinese restaurant. Good inexpensive food. We've been going here since we moved 10 years ago.
If it is available on the menu, then I tend to be a creature of habit by ordering Kung Pao Chicken at practically every Asian restaurant I visit. This restaurant was no different. In a way, it's my barometer for judging Asian cuisine. Unfortunately, I was not impressed with their Kung Pao Chicken at all. The chicken was tough and dry while the sauce was clumpy and somewhat syrupy.  The texture to this sauce reminded me of melted caramel and not the typical thin Kung Pao sauce. The taste was mostly sweet and tangy rather than spicy. A strange taste for a Kung Pao dish.  It just was not enjoyable.  On the other hand, the shrimp stir fried noodles, potstickers, and won ton soup were great. My wife and I were really pleased with all these noodle dishes and how they were cooked, steamed and fried to perfection. All the vegetables, seafood and meat in these dishes were fresh and delicious. The cabernet sauvignon was a perfect complement to wash down all these dishes. 
Parking is a bit limited but there is some in the back.
I came here on Chinese New Year Day, the whole restaurant was fully packed. That's one way to prove how good and authentic the food is ! Luckily we made a reservation so the table is ready as soon as we were there. One thing I do have to point out in regard of the service is that there is no hostess stand by the entrance so in order to get a table, I pretty much walked inside the restaurant and got someone's attention to look up the reservation for me. But again this is not a restaurant in a casino on the strip so customer service might be a little bit off , plus it is Chinese New Year, everybody working was super busy. 
I love this place!
Great service and great food! Always come here for lunch special! The teriyaki chicken is one of my favorite! They are also pretty fast with service. Just my opinion though, you just have to find out for yourself
Good food! Fresh!
However, since I was with my parents, we were able to order several things and shared it all. We had the Curry Chicken, Pepper Beef, and General Tso's Chicken. We'd also ordered the Chicken Dumplings and the BoBo platter.
the rice was kinda good, kinda salty.. but it was supposed be fried rice.. it was brown.. maybe thats the fried part? i always had veggies (carrots and peas) n scrambled egg pieces in most chinese fried rice.. not here.. oh well.. i wont be ordering here again..
You definitely must try Red Mansion at the Downtown Grand.  I heard they got off to a little bit of a rough start, but they completely revamped the menu and brought in Chef Yu who is from Beijing and cooks the "real deal" when it comes to Chinese food.  
A great place to eat after your drunken night of partying, Noodle Asia is open late and offers a variety of hearty warm dishes that are somewhat overpriced, but that taste REALLY GOOD when you're drunk.
A dish that stood out the most was the salt and pepper tofu. It's listed on the appetizer menu, and it was super tasty! Next time I would get that as part of my main dish, and order some stir fried veggies to go with that or something. 
My favorite is the General Tso's chicken, but I'll only order that if I have time to dine in. Otherwise, by the time you get to your destination the chicken is not crispy anymore. Especially since they put it in those plastic bowls that seals it shut.
food is not bad, but for all the reputation of Puck, it's way below expectation.
At first we were miffed because the hostesses told us there would be a 10 minute wait and to get a drink at the bar...however tumbleweeds could have been blowing through and there was no need to wait.
Well this trip the restaurant probably did not lose money on us.  We spent over $60 on food and a couple of beers.  With tax and tip the bill was slightly over $80 and with the $25 coupon, I paid $55.
Closed!
OK so to the food.  We ordered the Shrimp and Cream Sauce, Orange Chicken, and an order of the Crab Puffs.  Portions are more than generous.  The Shrimp with Cream Sauce was um, interesting.  The shrimp were large, well cooked, and there was a decent amount of them for the price.  I prefer spicy dishes so it was a little on the bland side for my tastes.  On it's own the dish was not what I would consider Chinese.  It was more like an attempt at a crustless shrimp pot pie than an Asian inspired meal.  A few shots of Sriracha helped a bit.  Probably wouldn't get that one again just for that.  It was ok, just not what I expected.
In terms of food, I don't have major complaints. The food was good, quite authentic, and fairly priced. But if you ask me to compare Chou's Kitchen to the street food I had growing up in China, Chou's does not come close in taste and quality.
This place is bomb! The best orange chicken i have ever had. Definitely my favorite chinese place we have found since we have moved here !
Sesame Chicken (one of my favs, has a honey-ish perfect sauce)
This place is really cool and has some of the freshest Noodles in town. Just happened to be in the neighborhood and had to check them out. After all they have a dude in the back tossing noodle up and down and slamming them on a large table. You can see him through the kitchen window.
Cash only so be prepared.  You do not need a reservation. Are you kidding? The service is very friendly but understaffed.
Well the place is clean and my friend said that his dish (Orange Chicken) was just ok,  After I was done eating I felt my stomach screaming 'WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME, I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN YOUR FRIEND'.  
It included an egg roll which didn't taste like the typical egg roll.  Appropriate, because it was served with (*outrage!*) yellow sweet and sour sauce!  
The bad: Prices. It's expensive. However, you're int he Venetian - whaddaya expect?
This new Chinese Restaurant just opened in Waterloo, so it's early days yet.  They speak Mandarin, not so much Cantonese or English, but are helpful.  Tried the Spicy Chicken with Rice special and it was quite tasty, not too spicy, but had a good kick.  Service was fast but I was the only person in the restaurant.  They're working on their cash register, so I had to pay by cash, they didn't have debit working yet.  The restaurant is located in the same plaza as Starbucks at King and University.
 As far as the service goes, they seemed freindly enough & I realize I get to these places when the help is having thier lunch and they have to eat too, but I still had to get up and ask for a water refill and that is NBD to me at all under the circumstances.
This place is a scam if your a tourist. They'll take advantage of you! 
Oh yeah, the prices are exceptional.  I have had some of the best chinese in the world and for the price, this is one of the best.
Despite what people say about China Joe's, I used to love ordering from them. I would get their Curry Chicken lunch special and be perfectly happy. That was about ten years ago.
I came here in my first year as my friends and I were looking for somewhere to get our fried-rice-fix. Dragon Way fell into our lap and it wasn't the nicest of experiences. Bleugh.
The next day we went back a little earlier for breakfast as they are the  only restaurant that offer soy milk and the green onion pancake and some other kinds of dim sum.  We were told the same thing that the waiting time would be at least 30 minutes despite the fact that there was not such a big crowd.  That same woman kept telling everyone to wait outside of the restaurant and many people left just like yesterday. We decided to wait and in less than 10 minutes, we were seated.  That same woman who was in charge of handing out numbers to people came and gave us the breakfast menu.  She told us that we have to order everything at one time and they will not allow customers to order anything after the initial order.  That seems to be strangest rule in any restaurant.  One of the dish that we ordered was steamed buns and when it got to our table, the buns were cold.  Not lukewarm but cold.  I then took the dish and showed it to a waitress. (It was impossible to get any waiter to come to your table and if you are lucky enough to get one, they will not remember what you asked for and you will keep waiting for nothing.)  I told the waitress that the buns are cold.  Instead of taking the dish back to the kitchen and get it fixed, her first response was, 'Do you want it then?'  So I said no despite the fact that it was the one thing my five-year old son would eat.  We then simply tried to finish the meal and get out of there.  We asked for the check and was told that you had to walk to the front to pay.  When I got the bill, the 15% tip was already included in the total of the entire bill.  I asked then whether this is something that Las Vegas restaurant does.  The guy then just took the bill away and immediately gave me another one without the tip added and left a blank line of the tip amount.  I then asked for some change as I wanted to give him the exact amount and he refused to give it to me.  I decided at that point that this restaurant does not deserve a single dime of tip.  
You know why I'm giving this place a three star? Because it just wasn't that memorable. I had to look through the pictures on Yelp! to remember even going here. I will say the atmosphere was VERY nice and the servers were also top-notch... but at the end of the day I wouldn't find myself running to go back for a second round. That's not to say the food wasn't great and the drink selections weren't wonderful... it was simply "A-Ok.", as the three stars imply.
 All in all my husband and I enjoyed our experience at the restaurant. Next time, we'd like to get there at a time where we could actually be seated on the patio so that we can enjoy our food outside.
I actually really like this place. The food is really good and it comes out really fast! They stay opened till 3am the day i went in. The waiters were really friendly. I also love how it's in the Venetian. But this isn't the place for you to take your date to!
 They don't skimp on things, we get cashew chicken a lot and there is a lot of chicken and cashews  it's not loaded with celery.. and they use good mushrooms not canned ones. They don't seem to cut too many corners. But the appetizers are kinda pricey for the amount of food or the quality you get. The beef skewers were not too great (pounded thin), the pot stickers are yummy (not excellent but good) but were expensive in my opinion.
With all that said, it's just ok. It's nothing special. It's just food that won't break your wallet if you're nearby and feeling some quick Chinese food in large proportions.
-The egg rolls were pretty basic.  Possibly store bought and just fried.  But damn was the ginger strong in them.
Have always loved the food here! You must get a dish with their noodles! Or you are really not trying what the restaurant thrives at. Like going to a BBQ restaurant and getting a salad. 
What I thought was really rude was that the lady brought us the wrong order to our table. We were hungry so we were gonna start eating. And she came over and took all the food without saying anything. So we were so confused. 
The eggrolls are just like home! The staff is quick, just like in New York. And the brown sauce is excellent. I have had their shrimp with broccoli in garlic sauce and was very happy with it. I have had their wonton soup, which was excellent. I have had their chicken chow fun which was exactly like I remembered from back East. 
Yelpers, you let me down...
The service at this place is pure poop. The drive through is a death march. The inside service is terrible. All they have to do is scoop food on a plate, this seems to be too much of a challange for the staff. Coach your people! I like Panda from time to time, but this location is a real let down. The quality of food is consistant with others.
Last few tries have been more hit and miss.  Difficult to order and food quality has been off sometimes.
Lets just say I love that I can order Chinese food and have it delivered to my place! Came home on a Sunday night after being gone all weekend and the kids and I were starving, so I said lets order something, so we ordered beef fried rice, crab puffs (my fav!!!) orange chicken, pork lo main and after we placed the order company showed up and I asked him if he was hungry and he said yea I told him we just ordered some chinese, do you want some, he said ok, but didn't know what to order, so off we went to Red Dragon, my phone order was already out the door by the time I got there, he ordered pepper beef and egg rolls, we took it home and had a good dinner! Now I have a take out menu at the house LOL.
Actually came here as a "mystery shopper," auditing the quality of service and food here a year ago.  A quick background on me, I'm Chinese and have been to MANY Chinese restaurants, from trendy to tradition.  This particular one, being in Vegas, on the strip, is definitely on the trendy side.  
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LJQCv30PCIpC3FnvHF5mXQ?select=7P3me3zI8jQohwt-42yNVg
Service is really nice, and they get your order out with haste. I just wish they'd bring back the 80s arcade machines in the dining area.
So much has changed since I first discovered Mini Pot. Qi (the owner) has added a lot more variety to the menu. There are a few additional pots and a ton of new sides. 
By The Rue
Most of my life I have ordered beef with broccoli from every single chinese restaurant I have eaten in. The last time I was in The Prime I decided to try something new that I could share with my lovely lady. 
4 asked to pack my leftovers w/ some extra rice too
Me: .....?? *In my head* I'm freakin Chinese give me the Chinese one! 
authentic northeastern chinese cuisine! thanks!!!
The restaurant was busy but we didn't have to wait at 7:00pm.  The food came out less than five minutes after we ordered.
One of the managers at my job decided to treat us to Flo's for lunch yesterday. I practically did cartwheels in my aisle because a) I was determined to eat out on my Friday and b) I love Flo's. I can't recall if anything I have eaten there was subpar. I ordered the Pepper Bacon Shrimp which is mixed with tomatos, cabbage, and bacon. With this you can choose between white or brown rice, and it comes with their house salad. The dressing is spicy and unique. They also bring out wontons with a sweet and sour sauce. Between those and my affinity for chips and salsa, I will never have a six pack. Anyhoo, service there is speedy without you feeling rushed. That place runs like a well-oiled machine. It is nice when you go during your lunch hour because you are in and out within the hour, usually. My husband says their Mongolian Beef is the best he has ever had and since he comes from the Seattle with plenty of Asian food, I believe him. There lunches are on average $7-9. Not bad considering the amount of food you get. I can usually make a second meal with my leftovers. I wish they would bring a Flo's down to Central Phoenix so I could have it more often.
disappointed..good but.. Love the Summerlin location. 
3.  A huge a** fish tank of exotic fish.  
My family is down for getting delivery from them again, very acceptable food quality and okie dokie experience. Would recommend to others :)
There was an odd burnt or chemical taste/smell associated with the Thai noodle bowl. (almost like the cooktop had a considerable build up of bad oil and other things?  I ate perhaps (3) three bites from the pad thai noodle bowl. I could not choke down anymore. 
There seems to be a line during the day which is not bad.  The restaurant is located right next to the sports betting area so a quick glance over to see the score is awesome. - Enjoy!
I ordered the spicy chicken dumplins, Vegetable lo mein and finally vegetable chow fun with soft tofu.  
Other than the lack of variety with taste, the restaurant is great to pick up food from.
good thing:  If you want some beer or saki with your meal.. guess what? they have it!
I always order the Hong Kong style pan fried noodles seafood always good. The salt and pepper crab is must also.  If you like steamed chicken this is the place to get it and I prefer it cold.
Consistently 4 stars:
The General Tao and Orange chickens are moist and juicy chunks of meat fried in a light and delicate but still crunchy batter and covered with sauces that make my eyes roll back in my head. I'm not usually a fan of the orange chicken, but the orange isn't overwhelming- it's subtle. Same for the general's chicken... the spiciness comes as the aftertaste. *drool* YOU CAN WILL FEED MORE TO MOUTH HERE, PLEASE?
If you like salt, this is the place for you!  Pretty bad from soup to noodles.  Even the rice was disappointing.   Tried to finish the meal with green tea ice cream and they were out.
Tott's is a good local Chinese joint.  It's got cute decor, tasty food and reasonable prices... what more do you need?  
Pan Fried Dumplings- really good I can taste a little ginger or something I couldn't point out but really good same with sauce.
On the other hand, some of my favorites here are the fish and ginger on rice(the basra fish is great in al the dishes), the spaghetti with the fish again, the eggplant with the ground pork, and bitter melon with beef, the Chinese vegetables with garlic, chow mein...Those just come to mind at the moment.
Was starving when i went to eat there last night and on the waitresses recommendation ordered the spicy beef soup which was delicious! Also had har gow and red wonton things for entree. The BBQ pork and duck on rice was ok. For the 2 of us including a pot of tea was $53 tip not included. Compared to other places in Vegas.. Tasty and a bargain and the waitress was excellent. Food came out quick as well. Definitely would eat here again!
We order take out from here in our office quite a few times. Every time the food is pipping hot and delish! I love the Honey chicken it's YUMMY. I love their lunch specials and prices.
Def get your moneys worth.
The quality of food is excellent. Everything is fixed fresh while you wait. The rice is a very good quality. Cooked correctly, never mushy as in many other places.  You can't get a better quality anywhere in the area. Go see them!!
If you would like to know the difference between "American" Chinese food and authentic, here is the place to go for the real deal! Absolutely delicious,
The food on the other hand was above average for a Chinese place. We ordered a smorgasboard of everything and most things I tried were light and fresh tasting rather than greasy. Additionally I didn't get sick from an MSG overload, so that's a great sign. 
Haus Noodle Soup 
I went there after 12:30 it was crowded, & Loud w/children crying and complaining.  The food on a scale of 1-10, I would rate a 4.9.  Some food was heated properly, some was not.  The Hot Sour soup was very good.  Chicken wings were good, so was the Hunan Beef, the fried rice was bland and tasteless.  The best thing was that it was reasonably priced....I guess that means it wasn't all that good but there was a lot of it at a reasonable price.(Meant to be funny)  A lot of the spanish men were in undershirts that were dirty, which isn't the fault of the resturant, but you'd think there would be some sort of notice to at least be clean.  The waitress was quick and kept my drink refilled, was polite, and appeared overworked.  A eat cheaply, and go type of place with a spanish working type crowd.
The dishes came out one at a time but close enough together that we didn't finish one before the next one.  The lo mien and fried rice were good; the shrimp with snow peas was excellent, and the mu shu pork came already wrapped in the pancakes - four fat pancakes full of excellent mu shu pork and lots of plum sauce.  We ate until we were satisfied and brought home enough food for one more meal each and one more round of rice and lo mien.  It was pretty yummy.
My egg foo young was decent but unremarkable.  Will definitely hit this spot against some time
Chinese crepe(http://www.youtube.com/w...), in Waterloo? Not in my wildest dream would I imagine something THAT crazy (and sweet).
Now my favorite foods in the world are soft gau gee mein and stuffed duck, so being a fatty, I ordered both, plus an order of crispy gau gee to go on my way back. (I did end up taking half of the gau gee mein and stuffed duck home). While Wo Fat earns stars for just living up to that nostalgia factor, the food is just not as good as back home. The gau gee mein gravy was not flavorful and neither was the gau gee itself. The stuffed duck had lettuce in it (!?) but was good otherwise. The crispy gau gee though was great.  
Its Panda.  Its not real Chinese food, and the "Gourmet Chinese" sign made me giggle.
I am still pissed off 3 days later.  Funny thing is they didn't do anything wrong in particular - I just get pissed spending money on crappy food!
I signed up just to leave this review because we have finally, after a looooong  search, found decent Chinese food.  We've tried EVERY Chinese delivery in our area and every one rated from "just edible" to "totally disgusting."  We were totally psyched when we received our delivery order.  The food was hot and tasted fresh. We ordered General Tsos, Chicken with Garlic Sauce, hot & sour soup, a veggie egg roll and a chicken egg roll. The hot & sour wasn't great, not sour enough and a little bland. Everything else was terrific though. The General Tso featured nice white chicken and wasn't fried to death. Sauce was quite spicy and good. Chicken with garlic sauce had a nice spicy, very garlicky sauce, white chicken and some tender crisp veggies. Both types of egg rolls were tasty and had nice crunch. (Duck sauce would have been nice though.)  The only thing I would skip would be the fried rice, it was just so-so. We will definitely be ordering again. Not the best chinese I've ever had, but certainly the best I've had in Phoenix in this area for sure!
Note to new owners...you should have never changed the phone number!  When we visited it was noon on a Friday and they had 1 table of guests.  I have never seen such a poor lunch turnout.
Love this place!!!
Service was great. The place stays open until 3am which is great for Las Vegas.
I still love the China Grill.  Kudos also to the lychee mojitos.
On my first visit (of what will likely be many to come) a group of us ordered:
Service is good as expected when they serve a packed house. The food is decent and flavorful. It really reminds me of a hole-in-the-wall type Chinese restaurant with really discounted lunch specials.
Best authentic Chinese food in the area. Great atmosphere, friendly staff, and delicious food. We'll be back!
Well, it sure was but we were hungry, and we did pretty well with it.  We polished off the spring rolls, cucumber salad, and mushroom purse and ended up taking home leftovers of the soft noodles and shrimp.  
We decided not to order from Malee's because we wanted something a bit cheaper. God, that was a mistake.
I got myself situated at a completely comfortable booth, & started out by sampling some of the many tasty fruits out, including mango with cream!  The table tag informed me that this place is affiliated with Great Dragon on Bethany Home (4-Stars!), & Best Buffet in Glendale, which I haven't tried yet.
A solid pick if you are in the mood for Chinese.
We probably get take out from Li's 3 or 4 times a month. For the most part, the food is quite good, but there have been some inconsistencies. My husband loves the veggie lo mein and the avocado salad, in part because of their huge portions. The won ton soup has become our favorite and the cheese won tons (like rangoons) are always fresh and more flavorful than many other places. 
While China Wok has red sauce, thick noodles and specialties that I could probably make it's decent when you're in a bind, have nothing in the fridge and live 2 minutes away. They also have a pretty large delivery radius, and it's only ten bucks minimum, so even if you're solo you can probably hit that mark. 
The pecking duck came with steamed buns (my favorite!), but they weren't good enough for me coming back.  I did love that they took all the bones off the duck though so I was able to eat to my hearts content.  The egg drop soup was... Ehhh.  I could've made it better at home.
Good food for a good price in a cute restaurant. Tasty veggie bao. However, if your vegetarian or vegan, I recommend specifying this, as my soba with tomato definitely included some beef broth that I chose to ignore due to massive hunger. In and out in like 20 minutes. Definitely worth checking out, even if you have to go to Hilldale to do it :D
5 Stars for "Old School"   Americanized Chinese food, in an authentic  funky retro Chinese restaurant environment.  Fresh, flavorful, and priced right.  
Now, the beef and broccoli - well the broccoli was actually more of a highlight. The beef was a bit chewy, so that's something I hope can be improved upon. Otherwise, I'd definitely recommend NYCR and would gladly eat their food again.
As hotpot goes there's a spot where you go make your dipping sauce that includes the Chinese BBQ sauce, scallions, soy sauce, black vinegar and I forgot the rest. (I only use those)
And from speaking to the waitress, the business at the restaurant is pretty much split between hot pot patrons and those ordering off the menu.
It's Simple. It's Amer-"asian" food.  We all know it's not authentic.  You're not crossing the Great Wall after battle for a great meal.  It's a good filling meal when you've been walking around for a couple hours and want to sit inside (upstairs when available/open) and chow down with a great view of State St.
* Half tea half coffee drink - hot or cold depending on temperature outside.  Add some condensed milk and you have a flavorful drink with some caffeine.
Restaurant had good ambiance and the wait staff was attentive.  Entrees were $10 for the tofu and $11 for the chicken, which was a bit high relative to portion size.  I feel that Dragon Wok is trying to be an "upscale" Chinese restaurant in the model of PF Chang's.  PF Chang's is not one of my favorite restaurants, but at least their menu expands beyond the most basic of carry-out standards and they know how to fry their chicken.
One tip: Order from the "Chinese menu". If you're looking at the menu that has "Mongolian Beef" or Egg Foo Yung, that's the wrong menu. 
The food is expensive. Not worth it.
The store is clean and I have never had any problem with them.
next time I've to try the mango pudding..
The food is very good and the portions are very large!  We specified that  we wanted our appetizers first, then the main dishes, and we got exactly that -  many Chinese places serve everything together whatever you request.  It may not be the best place to go if you're in a real hurry, but the flip side of that is the food tastes like it's cooked to order.
THE BEST Chinese food in Madison, hands down.
For the previous reviews about the cleanliness of the restaurant I can't comment on for I have only had delivery and just based on the food we order (at least twice a month) I have to give Mr. Hunan's four stars. Is it great, no but it's very good and a super value for the dollar.
But there are some days when I earn for the simple, straight forward Chinese food I remembered eating growing up on the East Coast where good eats were plenty in the Chinatowns of New York and Philadelphia.
 So despite whatever anyone says about Sing High, I look to it as a place I can discreetly stuff my face with unpretentious chinese food for next to nothing and admire the ghosts of ages past that all did the same at one point or another.
Be thankful that we can have some authenticity in this city and go eat there now!
Over a 4-night stay, I chose not to return, but I wasn't disappointed with my meal.
Came back recently to get more of their bomb Garlic Crispy Chicken Wings and noticed that they also have a spicy version.  I opted to go with my old fav, and it did not disappoint.  I also ordered the Curry Chicken over Rice (you can also have it over noodles instead), and the curry was good.  However, the larger pieces of chicken were slightly undercooked, just the way the French Chefs like their poultry. 
The price was reasonable, the service was prompt. 
Enjoy!!
One of my favorite chinese restaurants in vegas!
Yelp was spot on with this lovely little place.  The food is very authentic and fresh.  The vegetable dishes and noodles were first class.
Sweet and Sour Chicken: yum.
Sweet Fire Chicken (?) was pretty good though. Seasoning, sauce, freshness, and texture felt just right.
When I first moved to Vegas from California I was told that Vegas has the worst Chinese food ever. Then one day I happened upon China A Go Go. The food is very good especially Buddha's Delight, the egg rolls are delicious and the crab rangoon is to die for. The service is amazing... Around Christmas when they deliver to us, they gave us a Christmas gift.  They have great food and great customer service, something that you rarely see now at days... I love China A Go Go
Wait staff attentiveness was something else ..... its like you don't exist after your meal arrives.
wow... i dont know if this place went down hill or is just bad. i will never EVER be going back...
Not wanting to complain but beware. Our soup was brought to the table lukewarm.
We've had it in the past (like over 4 years ago) but I can't say I recall how it was but recently were craving chinese food delivery and got it already a few times in the past 3 weeks and I gotta say that it is top of our list for to-go/delivery food.
Regardless, the food was some of the best chinese I've head. My husband and I shared the hot and sour soup (which is a huge serving, by the way), as well as the lettuce wraps (equivalent to PF Changs or Yard House - good but basic). My brother had the egg rolls and was very pleased. I had chicken and vegetables in a white sauce, and my husband had the same in a lobster sauce. My brother had sweet and sour chicken, and each was very, very good. The leftovers tasted great as well! We will come back the next time we have a craving for chinese.
Convenient
Oysters w/ Green Scallions in Sizzling Pot - Good.  A big greasy tho.  But very tasty.  Never had a dish like this before, so I liked it.
I live in the area and have frequented The Prime Chinese Restaurant many times. The place is great for lunch and dinner. The serving sized are very large. And the meals are delicious. I recommend the vegetable egg foo young. The service here is very good. You will most likely be greeted by an older Asian woman. She owns the place and is so friendly. I work in marketing and SEO so I offered to help them with getting some more exposure but she seemed doubtful that they would be in business come the new year. 
I just got off work from Outback Steakhouse that is right across the street from Chen's. I was extremely dog tired and hungry from a long day's work serving tables and wanted to get a quick bite to eat. I carelessly walked into the restaurant and realized that it was empty and they were 2 minutes to closing (I was that guy). I immediately said I would go somewhere else but they stopped and insisted that I could order something to-go. 
Restaurant... don't know about Szechuan Palace now that they changed ownership but this is one of the real gems in the valley
Food is tasty, just underwhelming in presentation. At $22 it's priced in the high side.
Whenever I eat Chinese (and by Chinese I mean western style take out food) I pretty much always get the same thing
I like their Orange chicken and crab puff. it is exceptional. I will continue.
Meh.  The stars remain.  I keep going back...so I guess its accurate to state that:  Yay, I am a fan indeed.
We got Pork Lo Mein, Chicken Lo Mein and Mongolion Beef. My Husband loved his Mongolian Beef (i have had better). My pork Lo mein was disgusting! My dad had the Chicken Lo Mein and he said it was good. The best part about the meal was the rice. That was actually good! But it came in a very small container. I will not go back here again. For $27 I can find better Chinese.
All the food tasted like fish, and fish only.  Unfortunately none of us ordered fish.  Even the rice tasted like fish... not good sushi taste, but heated-up-in-the-sun fish juice from a dirty street fish taste.  Usually you can wash it down with an egg roll, but I think that's what they used to create that fire scene mentioned above.  It was like a black log.
This place gets a 3-star "A-OK" rating because for a fast food Chinese place, it's "A-OK." 
Having spent five years in Hong Kong- Central, Mongkok, and Wanchai, some of the best chefs in the world reside there.  Well now with Chinese Food Scottsdale (Jade Palace), we have found their counterparts in Scottsdale, Arizona!
The food quality and taste where not what they used to be. I order the Twice spicy cooked chicken and it was over run with hot red peppers to the point it was almost inedible. The bbq fried rice was awesome though. 
You must not pass this one up.  Go ASAP for a great meal.
Anyway, like I said the food is decent and a good price for what you get. But I don't know how many more conflicts I can get into with their staff before I decide to call it quits from this place for good. 
Likely because a diner on the other end of the grill claimed an allergy, and protested seafood being grilled at the same time as steak, the remaining 9 diners were deprived of any complimentary appetizer shrimp.  Then, when the grill master became too engrossed chatting and laughing along with two male diners at the other end of the grill, he neglected to keep a careful watch on the meat, and our requested medium rare Filets soon became medium before he cut them into cubes and removed them from the grill.  I found a piece of shell from a shrimp in the midst of my food, and one of my dining companions reported encountering egg shells in his Fried Rice.  
Started with some salty crab puffs and some excellent chicken egg rolls. Nothing to rave about. Wouldn't go back.
They do not use fresh ingredients, or at least they cook so badly to make it seem that way.
Complimentary Mung Bean and Tapioca Dessert- It is served warm and reminded my family of our favorite Vietnamese dessert. It is made in a similar fashion to the Vietnamese style as well. It is less soupy and thicker.
I ordered the sauteed veggie lunch special and requested it spicy,  it was delicious!  They give you tons of food and sides which were fried rice and noodles.  It  also came with a small soup and what looked like fried rice crackers.  It was all tasty n hit the spot all for a little ovrr 5 bucks!  Matthew ordered the Mongolian beef which he said he loved.   I think we found a favorite lunch place.  The service was great they were very attentive.
This place I like for its General Tso's chicken, egg foo young, and their mu shu. I haven't tried their other plates simple 'cause I found what I like and I'm happy with it. Their staff is always friendly and every once in a while when I go there near closing time I get free soup or rice or egg rolls. Lately I've noticed they are taking longer and longer to deliver but I give them a break since they only have one guy doing all the deliveries and they get swamped some days.
this place is so good.
Tip for the owners this is America, not China. Work on your customer service skills
- Although I did not have the desserts, it looked good enough for me to come back and give it a try sometime.   
But DGE just has this happy, quiet vibe to it. And clean to boot. The place is splotless, with a hint of chow mein goodness. If I ever own a house, that's what I'd want my kitchen looking/smelling like all the time.
Really great service, and the main entrees were great (Mongolian Beef and Vegetarian Gardein with Cashews). Not very spicy for being labeled as spicy, but still delicious.
"Bistro" is the operative word in the name.  If you're looking for a dining experience, you'll be out of luck here.  Yangtse is (however) my "go to" place for take-out chinese food.  Fresh, flavorful, large portions and good prices.  Been ordering here for years and have yet to be disappointed.
The daugher liked her Kung Pao chicken.  Hubbie's shrimp dish was good too, but the broccoli ringing the dish could have been cooked just a little bit longer...it was pretty much raw.
You're eating yummy Panda Express food!
The menu is very odd, kind of chinese but not really.  I had the dumplings for appetizer which were fine and the chinese short ribs for dinner which were disappointing, not nearly as tender as I had hoped.  I did enjoy the goat cheese mashed potatoes.  I wouldn't go back.
Rice is hot and fresh and delicious.
Granted, you can get any of these dishes for half the price off the strip, but for the convenience, I'm ready to shell out the extra dough.
Meh...it's pretty decent food and all but there is better to be had in this area. The people were fairly friendly but could care less about being very personable and having a conversation.
We went and had a vermicelli with minced pork, eggplant with garlic sauce, and the spicy chicken dish.  The spicy chicken dish was very good if you like some heat in your food.  I found the eggplant with garlic sauce somewhat oily, but it went well with some rice.
The biggest issue I have is inconsistency in the cooking.  For example, the Kung Pao Chicken on one day will be prepared and seasoned totally differently the next time you order it. As a result, sometimes you may not like what you ordered. I get that the same cook can't be there all the time, but there results should be at least somewhat similar. 
I've been here once and tasted some of their menus. Not a fan of their food. So tedious and just an ordinary Chinese resto.
I am aware of this place for the past 10 years. I rarely bought stuff here... the displayed cooked dishes looked ordinary.
-huge dinner combo portion
The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. Not only did they serve us EXTREMELY salty food - for all three dishes and one EXTREMELY SOUR- we had three people in our party, so it's not just my opinion- when we told them to try it, they said it suits out taste and refused to cancel the charge until after thirty minutes of disputing with them. WILL NEVER RETURN HERE. (Btw Chinese people at our table so they actually know what it's supposed to taste like)
I finally went for dinner and ordered 1 whole roast duck and it was so delicious! It is definitely the best duck ever to exist in Las Vegas! 
Was not all the impressed by their dishes.  The one dish that stood out was the fried oysters. The XO string bean and fried rice were mediocre. Their seafood looked very good unfortunately they had run out of rock fish cod.
Those four orders were more than enough for four people, we had plenty of leftovers for sure! 
I have eaten here several times over the years when I'm not doing the pei wei or panda thing and it's always met expectations. Just the other day I placed an order for a cup of hot and sour, Kung pao and some wantons. It was ready to go and after a coupon(they were nice enough to take a 3 day expired one) it totaled about 12-15 with tip  the exact number escapes me.
Located in a little strip mall in Avondale in the Fry's parking lot this is the only Chinese food place that could be considered a mom and pop.  But its not.  
The bar area was nice, normal selection of top shelf liquors that one expects in Vegas, bartenders were quick and poured stiffly.  And after you pound down a few cocktails, head off to the bathroom for a real treat:  Some of the coolest bathrooms that I have ever seen.  I don't want to ruin the surprise, just go.
Just soso
I'd basically given up on good Chinese food in Madison until QQ Express opened up just earlier this week.  During the week, the entree selection offers way more options than you'd see at a some place like Panda Express.   The weekday specials are also very reasonably priced, and offer way more variety and volume for a dollar more than the Subway located next door.  But what keeps me going back is the amazing quality of the food, and the variety on the menu.
I am glad I found this place but it is a bit far from where I am staying at in Phoenix. Their dumplings are really good, spicy cold potato salad was super good and refreshing but their green onion cake was a bit thick and starchy for me. I prefer Taiwan's thin and crispy green onion cake. Really clean inside and it is fresh, full of Asians!
Place was crowded on  Saturday night until just after 8 when it cleared out and we finally got a table. Service is friendly even if a bit busy and absent minded. The cold dishes were good, but my favorite was the shrimp hotpot. The water cooked fish and the green beans both had a unique taste I couldn't quite place, but all in all decent. Spicy level is lacking if you're looking for real Szechuan, but this is probably more enjoyable for most taste buds.
My wife had the Fried Noodles with Chicken, and I had the Fried Noodles with Beef in Spicy XO sauce.  Enormous portions, and soooooo tasty.  Noodles were excellent, beef was super tender, and seasoning was just about perfect.
The reviews are kind of all over the place, so not sure what to gather except for our own experiences.  This is a usual place we hit up when in town.  But creatures of habit as we are, we always stick to the same dishes... can't miss right.  And they're always excellent.  
I love this place. We order take out about once a week. The garlic chicken with vegetables is very tasty as is the Mongolian beef.  Mushu pork is good. The lunch specials are a great value. The service is very personable and sweet.
Being that I am originally from the east coast, Boston, to be exact, where really good authentic Chinese food exists, I am a very picky snobby critic regarding Chinese food.  
Stay away unless you are a local who eats here all the time. My family and I were told that the wait was 30 minutes at 6 pm on a Friday night. We sat and waited for an hour and a half before we left without eating. The bartender, the hostess, and the owner all told us separately that our table was almost ready, you are next, and the table is getting up now. We watched as the locals came in and were greeted warmly and got a table in 10 to 15 minutes. I live 3 miles from Jade Palace so I am really a local as well but I am not over 65 years old and buddies with the owner. Worst Scottsdale service I have had in the past 11 years. Cannot rate the food this time because we ate at Jalapeño Inferno next door. They did a great job and seated us within the 15 minute wait that they told us it would be. I will not be able to review Jade Palace again because they will never see me or my family again. I will take my business to Pei Wei  at Grayhawk where great service is always provided.
The chicken was far from crispy, as it was completely overwhelmed in sauce and soggy by the time I got it back to work to eat. The fried rice was mushy, and the egg roll was overcooked. 
I tried some dumplings as soon as I got home and they were good. Lots of meat and pretty flavorful. Not the best I've ever had, but solid and a huge portion for the price. They're a new spot, so I give them the benefit of the doubt and I look forward to trying a few more of their menu items in the future.
This was god awful. 
My husband and I went in for lunch. I guess it should of been a red flag that the place was empty I mean there's a lot of businesses around. Your better off going to Panda Express on Avondale Blvd and Van Buren.
The roasted salt and pepper pork chops did not disappoint.  Albeit small chunks of pork chops, but incredibly tasty and juicy.
Awesome is the only word, everything is freshly prepared and perfect.  Great food and great prices.
(3) Fried beef buns (in Chinese, "water-fried beef buns"). So-so. Too much dough for my liking and too little filling. Also, not juicy enough.
A+ in my book, they even offer student discounts!
There's a 30 cent or 50 cent charge if you use your card. This place is in an awkward area too. Very hole in the wall, and trust me you won't get food poisoning here.
So, the noodles are clearly fresh, and it's a conceptual step up from the Americanized type Chinese one finds many other places here, and something different if you're not up for the heat level of Szechuan. But uh if you don't like fish? Skip this place. The first few times I thought maybe I made an ordering error, but there is no reason for BBQ Pork Lo Mein to taste and smell aggressively fishy. Both the broth (maybe there's some shrimp involved) and the noodles (which is far stranger). It's disconcerting and offputting. Maybe that's nitpicky of me, and maybe someone who ate fish wouldn't notice. But for me? GLECH. Their house-made hot sauce is awesome and conceals the worst of it, but I shouldn't -need- to conceal unwanted flavors like that.
Also the Wonton soup is super great when you are feeling under the weather. The Chow Fun is yum yum yummy!!
Smallish restaurant inside maybe 15 tables in an average looking space.  
I can't eat gluten anymore so while I used to eat here......now I go for other people who live with me!  It's good, fast and convenient food.  This location is always fresh because it's so busy.  The staff is great and they make Chinese take out less of a chore!  It's all good.
Went for my third time its good, but my food was not as hot and it had of a funny taste.
The plate I'm really basing my five stars on is the dish that they call special beef. The vegetables in this dish were truly stunning. How often do you get fresh crisp lotus root in your dish. This dish also had the most unusual interesting mushrooms that had a texture unlike any other mushroom I ever tried. The other vegetables were all fresh and crisp. The beef in the dish was nice and tender like an eye roast but it was a very small amount of meat in the dish. This dish was very lightly sauced like the way you are suppose to sauce pasta. This dish was highly recommended by the waitress as she told us it was their best beef dish.
5) lo mein rice is great 
6) Boba Milk Tea
Just opened-cute place, good food, great lunch specials, but there is something in the food...that makes me feel ick...I'm guessing, MSG.
Here's where the real problem came in. The bill arrives, and there is an automatic 15% gratuity already deducted, we were told for parties of 4 or more, however nowhere on the menu was this listed. My mom flips and spends the next 30 minutes arguing with the waitress, requesting her card's transaction reversed, and the automatic gratuity taken off. 
It was a great meal, with awesome service.  For a drink make sure you get the Hakka.  Loved the fact that we were escorted up the back to the nightclub instead of having to go outside.  I still prefer the Miami location though.
This has been my family's Chinese restaurant of choice for years! Great food. Great service. Never been disappointed!
Flo's is by no means authentic but some of the dishes are good for what they are and the ambiance is nice when it's not too loud.
I will be back!
Beautiful restaurant decor
Excellent service, great prices, and delicious food!! 
Oysters $5.95
The only reason I knew about this place was a hand lettered sign stuck into the ground outside the Viet Hoa grocery. 
Pleasant, good service, and reasonably priced. Enjoyed the shrimp chow mein (soft noodles).
All the reviews of terrible service are true.  Been to noodle shops and it's not rocket science, most of the work is already done.  No chit-chat needed, don't even need to be friendly- take the order, bring the food.  Noodles were good enough- won't go out of my way to rush back.
Food was AMAZING! 
The food was not nice at all- I ordered a MaoXueWang and it was 80% full of spring sprout！
AMBIANCE - 4.5 stars...like I said, pretty white-on-white decor with lots of goldfish 
The Bill: Was a little pricey, but worth every dime. I think we had two drinks each, a shared appetizer, the tasting platter and entree, and shared dessert, and it cost us about $100 each. If I lived in Vegas, I'd go broke dining at Pearl- but it would be totally worth it.
Most times I go to Wong's Place, I'm one of very few (sometimes the only) Caucasian(s) in the place.  Almost all the customers Are Asian.  When the people of an ethnic group eat their ethnic food in an ethnic restaurant, that's a *very* good sign!
I love this place for chinese food. I am from the East coast and I was always trying to find a place that even compares to what you get in Boston or New York.This place is as close as you will get and they are so fast with delivery.I always get my food within 30 minutes and it is steaming hot. They are always friendly.I have never had a problem and my order is always correct..
A Chinese restaurant in Vegas? There's no way they would ever be able to make authentic Chinese food.. WRONG!!
1. Black pepper beef udon-The beef was very fresh and the udon was made just right. However, it was a bit oily for my liking, but I was way too hungry, so I finished this whole plate! Lol!
Awesome place!! The portion sizes are decent. Service is wonderful and the lunch special can't be beat!
I love this place! The prices are amazing and they always take such good care of me. I'm not very picky but I always seem to bring friends that are. They always accommodate by preparing all of our dishes per request. The restaurant is always very clean and I love that they bring hot tea to your table as soon as you sit down. The staff is very educated on the menu and they always give great recommendations. I will be back and I will recommend to all of my friends.
Food is excellent and so are the prices. It's almost always quiet and the staff is great. I wish we lived closer to it.
I usually try to broaden out from my favorite menu items, but I find myself gravitating back to them. The lettuce wraps are VERY underrated and you get enough in one order to eat as a meal for one or two people. You get a big container filled with whole lettuce leaves and a giant bowl containing a mix of grilled meat, crunchy veggies, and little noodles. It's actually quite sweet and that pairs well with the taste and freshness of the lettuce leaves.
best mongolian beef anywhere, swear....
Yes it is more "western" chinese.  But it is light years better than PF changs, or other chain type places.
This place has one of the most friendliest staff! I usually come her to dine in. The service is fast and the food is tasty! I like how they give free soup when you dine in. The price of the meal and the serving is a great deal! They will also customize meals for you if you want to take something in/out or have the meat cooked a certain way like from another dish they have. It's a nice and quiet spot.
For the price we knew we'd end up paying we decided it wasn't worth suffering though this crap so we called the manager, told him we were unhappy with the food and left.
If the prices were  a bit lower and maybe a special every week, it would get itself out of the lul its found itself in.
Let's just say this. I feel sorry for you people who thinks this restaurant serves good food. Went there after reading all your fine reviews here. I will be short and sweet. Hot and sour soup was passable, the pad thai was edible. House chicken was big chunks of deep fried breading with salty brown sauce. Mongolian beef was salted jerky with green onions, and the fried rice is just white rice with soy sauce in it. The soda was okay. If you have ever had decent Chinese food,, stay clear. This is not it. Will someone get my money back?
Best wonton soup here! The foil wrapped chicken was an awesome app. There's always coupons, so check online to see what they are before ordering. I've never had them take the coupon, but you have to tell them which one you're wanting them to apply. Delivery times are accurate and they're worth a 45 min wait for it. Love them.
Service was pretty good, but I would not return even though it's right by my house. Very disappointed!!!
There's this movie called Big Trouble in Little China. Kurt Russell plays a truck driver with a mullet and a best friend that owns a Chinese restaurant. I know the movie is set in 1980s San Francisco Chinatown, but I like to think that it's actually QQ Express.
And my favorite is the Mongolian beef. And they serve a chicken dish, which I forgot the name, which is so good. Service has been okay and the prices are okay. I just wish they delivered.
Egg fo young to die for and dumplings that remind me of Chinatown NYC. Don't miss out on this amazing restaurant
Our family loved it...we came here with a party of 23.  This was a casual dinner for my cousin and her family from Georgia.  The kids had a table for themselves and they were grubbin'.  The waiters were very helpful with the menu.  Our favorites are the salt and pepper shrimp, salt and pepper pork chops and salt and pepper squid...hmmm...did we miss another salt & pepper dish?? LOL.....  The best dish was the beef hot pot. Yummmmm!!!! Even the most finicky of the family enjoyed it. We were stuffed!!!  ;o)
42. Kung Pao Chicken  - Good, but not great. Why? It needed a bit more spice. Every dish seen here was medium spiced...but Kung Pao needs to be hot. Fiery hot. This one...was just good. Still loved it enough that I'll order it again. 
It's a good place to start the evening and has a nice variety to the menu.  Overall a nice place and I like the open kitchen to see the staff hard at work!
As has been noted by the other reviewers, China Restaurant (kudos for the creative name!) is CHEAP. If you've only got $5 for lunch, this is where you want to be.
The portion was quite large and I couldn't finish it (and I'm a big eater!), and they have signs about not being able to share a hot-pot with someone else, which is the reason for it being a 3 star instead of a 4 star place. I might still go back, though, and try it again.
The other impressive thing... the driver figured out my apartment complex.  When I order delivery of any variety I always explain the gate system and leave my code for the driver so I can buzz them in.  And 9 times out of ten a driver calls me and asks me to come down and get my food.  GRRRRR.  Delivery means to my door and nothing less. My door is nowhere near the gates.  Siu Wok gets it done right!
We stood in line waiting to get up to the counter.  We stood in line waiting to pay for our food.  There's no excuse for there to be 3 or 4 people on the line jumping over one another to fill orders when there is only 1 person at the cash register.  And about 95% of the time, the person at the cash register was also filing orders.  
Live nearby and love Chinese food, especially Szechuan. Chose the Kung Bao as one of their Szechuan entries. Looked in vain for veggies in the dish, and tasted in vain for the hot, numbing flavor that characterize this dish in the more authentic versions. I'm guessing is that they prepared and cooked it according to Western or American tastes, which tend toward sweet rather something with something that fires up your palate. If that's what you want from Szechuan, here's the place.
The place had just opened and was pretty empty when we got there, but they made our food fast and they give you a really big portion for your money.  We also ordered an order of the pork & chive potstickers which I really enjoyed.  They are traditional potstickers where the wrapper actually sticks to the pot and you cut them off - I'd never seen that before but my honey said his childhood friend's asian mom used to make them that way.  Learn something new every day.
Not what you would expect from a strip mall restaurant!
We ordered salt and pepper pork chops here to compare with HK Star and the pork shop were better here but everything else was below par. 
Aside from my criticism of the Taiwanese food, this restaurant does a fantastic job both with the food and service. The decor is nonexistent, but I personally do not expect anything spectacular having come from Asia.
This restaurant is gone.  :(  It is now a place going to be called China Jade.
I did like that you can choose whichever kind of noodles they have for any kind of stir fry or soup style. That was a nice touch of customisation. The hand-stretched noodles were the best!! The knife-shredded noodles are a close second.
This was our first time ordering from them. We were very impressed with our order. 
Being of Chinese descent and growing up in family run restaurants, I know Chinese food.  There is a place for all types of Chinese food including fast food places like Big Wa.  The secret however, is that if you are a generic, run of the mill, sub par Chinese food restaurant, you need to compensate by having exceptional service and fast delivery.  This place fails on all counts.
I've eaten here a good 2 dozen times, as it is close to my work and delivery is super fast.
As with many asian restaurants, the servers seemed to dislike their jobs and life in general.  I guess it's all about the food, which was at least average here.  Another down side was the insane prices.  I could get equal or better quality in L.A. for 1/2 the price at one of my local over-priced restaurants.  I understand it is vegas, but I can almost eat at a decent steak restaurant for the same price!  I was over $40 for some noodles and stir fried fish.
Food
The atmosphere reeks of class from its ornate exterior to the gorgeous interior. My only gripe is that they're closed Mondays and that is usually when I need them the most.
Fast service, reasonable price , authentic Chinese food, but sometimes too salty and greasy for some food.
The food was as greasy as it gets.
The menu offers a nice selection of what I would consider more authentic food. Not what I would consider the typical "Americanized" dishes. 
- Orange Chicken (our choice)
when you go in it a really small diner with 4 or 5 tables , a tv and the counter. the food is already made served buffet style in warmer pans on a steam table. they have 2,3 and 4 item meals & a la carte. the lady ahead of me ordered the last of the orange chicken-apparently they weren't planning on making any fresh after 5 pm.
Beef and Broccoli - Overcooked and no flavor, per family member who ate it. 
As for my Braised Pork and Preserved Vegetables. YUUUUUUUMMMMMM! I was very impressed. The vegetables had an expected bitty vinegar-ness to them and the meat was EXTREMELY tender and flavorful. The slices were kind of thick so I was worried about eating them with a chopstick, but the meat was so tender that it fell apart in my mount and was not difficult to eat. I definitely recommend this dish, but as the waiter stated, be warned that it is fatty so don't order if you don't mind it. 
They have very affordable lunch specials and I suggest checking that out if you are free at that time. They are closed on Sunday so be mindful of that. 
I asked the waitress if I can buy a glass if milk from her for my son and she said that they sell them in a big container and it would be $3.50. So I told her forget it since I only needed a dippy cup full of it and then she said she would check. She filled the dippy cup and charged us $2.25. Blah.
Don't be fooled by the 5-star reviews on google - that's how I got fooled. It is an absolutely "don't go". Your appetite for Chinese food would be ruined by this restaurant.
Still my go to for great chinese!
*chicken fried rice
I will keep going here. Yum!
Funny that the house of Egg Roll only had one spring roll option.
I was fairly disappointed in the rice and chow mein.  I'm sure it was just some higher being's way of punishing me for not getting steamed rice, but the chow mein tasted bland and the fried rice tasted generic.   Is it as offensive as it sounds to say that I would have preferred Panda Express' versions of these?  I liked the sauce for the entree quite a bit, it wasn't nearly as spicy as I'd like, but the flavors of garlic, jalapeno, mushrooms and some bell peppers and onions shone through.  The chicken was just okay, and I definitely found the pieces that were drenched in the sauce to be better than the more dry ones.
Thanks for coming back to us Tott's. Life is complete again.
a great place to stop by for lunch. their lunch menu is ideally priced; $5 for a combo meal? beat that!
Fast, friendly, but flavorless. Beef and broccoli was tender but had the flavor of water
I didn't even get to try the food. I tried to order delivery, the first time I called they hung up on me without saying anything. The second time I called in they said they only deliver within 2 miles and hung up on me again.
4 stars for delivery alone!  
+Nice and clean interior for dining in
It's hard to find a Chinese take-out restaurant that I like... I don't know if it's because I'm expecting restaurant food or if it's because I'm just tired of eating Chinese food.
The tea was what you'd expect from any ol' Asian joint,
We used to go to Chinatown to find a REAL Asian flavor, but for the ambiance Rice & Co offers, I think from now on we'll just drive a couple of miles further...it's worth it.
Authentic! authentic!
The service was perfectly adequate and the food arrived promptly.
I started off with the Won ton Soup . I like my soup just how I like my ice cream and Guacamole ...chunky! I liked the bits and pieces of Won ton and pork in the broth. I'm used to a much wimpier Won ton soup so this was refreshing! I also snacked on the huge fried Won tons and egg rolls while we waited for our meal. The fried won tons are a nice size and the egg rolls are okay. 
Stopped in here for lunch the other day so I could try them out since we just moved in down the block. Found out they had a lunch buffet for $6.50. What a great way to try out a few things on the menu!
- We got a HK style mango crepe to go - it's nice they have that option. But they basically took one of the stale ones that's been sitting in their to-go display case up front because it's already boxed. It did not taste good.
Me and my friends had 2 tasting menus, the cods, and 3 hot and sour soups.
The place was absolutely empty on Friday around noon.  The dining room was clean, and the lighting was bright.  The Chinese zodiac place mats were right out of central casting.  (Good to know that I'm still a snake.)  There was an unusually large number of lunch combos, and they even made "Chicken & Broccoli" into a combo for my friend.  (His tastes aren't very exotic.)
Onions?  Do it now!
Get there early though.
Ordering the lettuce wraps and a few drinks easily put us over the $20.  The serving size was pretty generous for just 2 people.  It was enough to make 2 stuffed wraps.  1 of these well endowed wraps would have been enough.  The lettuce was also nice and very fresh.  A free California roll only makes it taste better.
I ordered the shiitake mushroom and chicken noodle soup (N5) and it was exactly what I wanted. Clear broth, veggies, and "wonton noodle" style noodles. The Thai iced tea was delicious with lemon instead of cream, it was like a southern-style sweet tea with an Asian twist.  
Yum!
On the other hand, the fish balls (yes, fish balls) weren't that exciting and for some, a little too fishy. Only complaint though really.
Good thing I only paid $6.00 for my lunch special. But let's just say I paid $6.00 for a very upset stomach for the rest of the day. 
The next day, I was sick all day. I called the resteraunt and complained when I got back to the hotel and they offered to replace my order. No way was I going to go for round two of the food poisoning game. Instead I told them that I would be posting this review and reporting them to the health department. DO NOT EAT THERE!! YOU WILL BE VERY SORRY THAT YOU DID!!
Overall, nothing too special, but not bad either - we left reasonably full. Might be more worth checking out during happy hour.
Love love love the food here. Service is blah but it's take out!!!  Totally worth it.
Since moving back to Arizona from California 5 years ago, we've tried out many Chinese food restaurants in the valley.  This is one of the best that we've found so far.  
Went for a big lunch again with my son and his family on Sunday, 10/7.  We all love this place -- "Hawaiian Style Cantonese Food"  -- and as you can probably guess, we are all ex-pat Hawaiians.  Let me begin with a funny comment  - a guy and his wife were there already at 11 am and ordered the standard, plate lunch special off the menu.  They had their cup of soup and some entree with an egg roll and fried rice on the plate lunch.  So when our food came (I will get to what we ordered later) he says to the waitress, "what was that they ordered?  It looks so good!".  To me, the funny thing is why did you come to this restaurant and order the crappy plate lunch off the menu?  No wonder why our food looks (and tastes) so good and your lunch looks and tastes like crap.
I came back last Saturday and ordered myself the orange chicken to go before meeting up with some friends that night. As always, the food was fantastic and my buddies are planning to stop by for lunch after they picked a few pieces off my plate. I hope you appreciate my sacrifice!
Wow. I'm so impressed. Service was great. Informative and patient. As you all know that is HUGE for an Asian restaurant. We had 5 different pots and all were really good. The pig feet pot was so tasty and the pigs feet were stewed perfectly. All three grilled skewers were also yummy. Last but not least- I have eaten fish balls my whole life- but none like these! Soft, fluffy, full of flavor. Must try.
It's a chain but they have amazing service and delicious food.  The portions seem to vary depending on how busy they are, but they're never tiny.  Go with an appetite and a friend (or many) so you can share dishes!
Anyway, I ordered one of their all day specials and it was done within a few short minutes.  The shrimp tasted fresh, everything was piping hot (yeah burnt my tongue getting a preview before I drove home). I felt that there was a lot more "sauce" than the rest of the food,otherwise it was tasty.
I've been coming here since I was a little kid and the food is consistently delicious. The service can be a bit weird but they totally make up for it with the food. They have the best homemade noodles in town. Try the hot and sour noodle, the bbq beef fried rice, and the crab rangoon. Amazing. Also, they deliver. This is some of the best quality delivery chinese food in Madison.
The fried rice was tasteless and hard. 
I have been here about 5 times now.  So it's pretty safe to write a review.
Quality check number one came from the bartender - "Everything is just fine," we replied. Quality check number two arrived and still no food for yours truly. Impatience having yet to set in, we replied that everything continued to be fine. Shortly after, I started noting other other patrons who had arrived long after we set foot in the place receiving their food. Quality check number three came to which I replied, "Have you seen a beef fried rice around here anywhere?" The bartender answered that food was delivered as soon as it was ready. Hmm... Okay. As time kept elapsing she offered a bowl of soup and even later, a drink on the house (I declined both). Finally, when I thought the anticipation could not get any greater, the "beef fried rice" was delivered. To say that it was sub-par would be a bit of an exaggeration; the first bite was cold as was the second. I started sticking my index finger in the heaping pile of "fried rice" sitting in front of me searching for any warmth. My excursions resulted in the conclusion that the beef was the only thing lukewarm on the plate. 
5. blast it really loud
Ok, I have been coming to Wong's Place for a number of years now. I found this little gem when I was wandering about Tempe (No I am not homeless, nor do I wander off when I drink) ;)
When we got our bill, I asked her to take the drunken chicken off because it was inedible, stale and not fresh at all. Plus, she had been the one who recommended it. They insisted that that's the way it was supposed to be made and refused to take it off the bill. They were obviously hustling us, did not give a damn about the quality of the food and were only about taking our money. 
I saw many people ordering the clay pot dishes and they had many choices to choose from. Service here is typical for a Chinese restaurant waive them down if you need anything otherwise they just ignore you! 
I've had food delivered from this place probably a total of 5 times.  Each time, it get progessively worse.   This time, we placed an order from my office and of the 3 orders, all were incorrect...items missing, wrong rice, etc.  Not to mention, the chicken in each of the 4 different chicken dishes I've ordered is really cheap and dry, the end pieces of dark meat covered in sauce do not make them edible.  Yes it's cheap and it's great that they deliver, but I won't be ordering from them again.
My wife and I make it a habit to come here everytime we come to Vegas, simply for their hot pot which is served only in the evening hours.  Mind you, we go to Vegas 6 or 7 times per year.  
Pong Pong serves up your basic Americanized Chinese food.  Portions are decent, and each meal comes automatically with fried rice rather than white rice.  The hunan shrimp with vegetables I had was served in a generic brown sauce laced with sliced cooked jalapenos and spiked with red hot chiles.  The tofu and vegetables, also in a generic brown sauce, was decent, and came with the silken tofu rather than the deep fried kind.  Prices are a little high for what I was expecting, since I can get more authentic fare for the same price in other restaurants in the Tempe/Chandler area.
This restaurant was the only reason I step foot in Monte Carlo. The quality is good for the chinese food. I have not tried their sushi so this review is based solely on the "cooked chinese" courses. 
-Main saving grace was the chicken fried rice.  This was the best thing on my plate(s).  That in itself was pretty yummy, but how hard is it to mess up fried rice??
2.  Parking - Strip Mall, no worries, easy parking. Easy to find on the corner of Horizon and Horizon near the Albertsons.
Also, if you bring a large group there, and split the cost, you will get a lot of food for your  money. I believe that we had about 11 people, and possibly about 11 dishes.
I dig Hunan Express, I order from here all of the time. A lot of the other Chinese delivery in the area is nigh inedible, and Hunan Express has good and plentiful food for cheap. The items are hit or miss but some are really good--I particularly love the hot and sour soup. On occasion they use a new recipe or something and I dislike it, but most of the time it's really excellent--full of tofu and fungus, as it should be.
The closest Asian place to the Palazzo so we went here. I was hesitant about it after seeing the prices but we reasoned that it's expected since we were on the strip. 
Gold Coast probably offers one of the nicest reward to its players.  Honestly, my fiance and I hardly play here (we both use his card), but he gets offers for free hotel room (premium room), $25 food credit, and $35 slot credit per day.  Thus, we ended up here for lunch.  
haha My dad did not know what to do with the pickled vegetables on a soup spoon starter. He emptied the spoon of the vegetables and saved the spoon for his soup. I guess it is there to cleanse your palate.
Long delivery wait
Very clean.  Excellent food.  Friendly service.  Would Recommend this restaurant to anyone.  Peking Duck nicely presented tableside.  Apps were pleasant.  Enjoy Long Jin.
"If you buy half a duck, you don't get to pick which duck."
one of the best Chinese restaurant in Madison
Crispy chicken a must!!!!
A couple of things I don't like, though, are that their sodas don't come with free refills and if you order take-out, it doesn't come with soup.  
Our family has made wongs chinese restaurant one of our favorite places to eat, because it is so special.The staff are helpful and always remember us and almost remember each of the meals we like.It is really clean with table cloths and you never wait for the food to come.Real chinese quisine - egg drop soup, crab puffs etc and tea.A nice experience ,thank you the Hickeys.
*Mu Shu Chicken 
This trip I decided to munch on the lettuce wraps, pork dumplings (steamed) and some new happy hour tacos. Fortunately one order of the tacos were wrong and I got them free. I had shrimp and mahe-mahe. While they were both of good quality, both were skimpy on size and flavor. In fact, they were quite plain. I would avoid these fill you belly with something good and flavorful. 
While the price may lure you in, food poisoning will certainly keep you away. Basically don't get anything after 10 PM that isn't deep fried or you'll run the risk of getting a sloppily cooked, half-raw pile of poison.
The interior of this place is something else.  the walls are red and turquoise with gigantic  reliefs of Chinese themes scenes.  Its a family run business and not everybody speaks English, so be prepared to order by letter on the men
Its not ghetto as I like it (food not as greasy, no fear for one's life, no dark corners with questionable contents) but its good lunch-time eating.
Everything is really delicious here. They're known for the spicy noodles and fried rice.. Ask the waiter for what's the best and they'll gladly recommend it. At these prices, I'm glad there is a place that offers good food. Good eats + empty pockets = Anne's sad face.. At least my belly is full and I can sleep happy!
I also love all of their meats on a steeeeeeeeeks.  :)  Perfectly seasoned and very moist and tender.  Pork fried rice is the bomb.
Sunshine Moon Peking Pub opened on Friday evening and my hubby and I were there the next night to give it a try! Located within walking distance of 5th and Wine and run by the same great people, Sunshine Moon's decor is fresh, vibrant, and not ridiculously flamboyant in it's Oriental flair like so many other places can be.
after being assured by the hostess that we could get in and out in an hour to make our showtime, we entered the soothing, blue/silver somewhat water-inspired decor of Fin. it was quiet, with the sound of flowing water and fresh liliy on the table - just what we needed after a long day.
- Water boiled (fish / beef / chicken) etc. is incredible and most highly recommended.
That wasn't bad at all. 
In summary, it has good food and if you are near to it I would definitely recommend this place for party food and takeout.  I would give this place 3.5 stars....but what the heck Ill give it a chance :)
as good as it could've been. 
We had the "great wall of . . ." chocolate cake. It's a multi-layered piece of dense chocolate cake, chocolate frosting, and chocolate chips (which I could do without). It's served with delicious raspberry sauce and berries (blue, ras, and straw). Delicious. Make sure to share.
1) Orange Chicken 
The food is amazing . Its freshness and taste was top knotch. Very unique and original plates are served in generous portions. This is definetly a sharing style kinda place.The dumplings are as fresh as you will get them and the wonton soup packs lots of flavor, however for me it was all in the entrees. We literally ordered every plate on the menu (big group) and can tell you that all of them were outstanding. I was getting karate chopped with flavor from every bite of every dish. I recommend the duck,Crab , Neptune pillow ,Seabass and soya prawns and compliment it with some Chinese broccoli and fried rice..BEWARE, if you are a panda express,  type of guy , you wont find most of those plates here.However, the menu has some items that wont freak you out and are catered towards the non Chinese guest. If you are into real Chinese food ask the server and the chef will make it for you 
I poked around my noodles and noticed they were really sparing with the ingredients. I found myself actually eating a lot of noodles before I got to any of the shrimp or BBQ pork.
Can't believe how bad this place is as far as order accuracy and priority.  Watched a 3-top get their food before mine, and I had one simple order.  Then some guy storms in, complains his takeout order was wrong, and then people who order after him wait forever to get their food.  It's as if we all lose at this place.
- Vanilla mochi ice cream
We stopped in here while waiting to get into the Bacchanal Buffet. The hostess took us to a table and said someone would be with us shortly. Weird ceiling and walls. After waiting for 45 minutes, no one had come to our table to take our order. We searched the menu and walls for any instructions that we weren't aware of, but there was nothing to indicate that we were to do anything but wait for someone to come to our table and take our order. We poured over the menu over and over, they seemed to have some exceptional and expensive dishes ($161.00 for some Kobe Beef), but no one came, so after 45 minute of waiingt, we left and went to an ice cream place.
Sitting down for lunch will get you some soup and fried wong ton, free of charge.
After reading all of the Yelp reviews for Beijing Noodle No. 9, we were unsure whether we should dine there, but decided to try them out anyway. To our surprise, not only was the food amazing, but the service was superb. These are the dishes we tried:
As far as the food goes, it's not something I crave. I have had great hot and sour soup there!  Full of meat, tofu and spices!  There Kung Pao dishes are always hot and the meat is really good. I would not get the chow mein. It's really greasy and the broccoli tastes like kerosene!
I'd say I'm going to order here again for sure.
Good vegan and vegaterian options
Bejing beef and spring roll,
The 2 stars instead of 1 star was solely because the staff kept our cups full.
We have tried various kinds of noodle and rice--the food is consistently delicious. The problem is HKS's service. We waited more than 30 minutes for our meals during busy hours on a Saturday. I in general support family-run small businesses, but they seriously need to improve the overall coordination of the restaurant. It's a mess. 
She ordered some battered fish, which tasted surprising good for a restaurant in a casino, fairly authentic taste and it had the right amount of spiciness.  The mussels were good, not too fishy, just right.  We also had some fried rice with seafood.
Overall: The food is Great, the prices is Great, the service is good.  Reservation is recommended if you are going during busy hours.
Oh. My. YUM! 
The food is ok, a bit greasy but most Chinese food is now-a-days. The staff is really nice and they will cook to order off the menu if you ask.
Crispy duck salad.  Incredible balance.  The richness of the duck balanced by the bitterness and acidity of pomolo, earthiness of pine nuts and texture from pomegranate seeds.  
They have a big selection, including duck, chow fun, even some Thai stuff, etc.
We ended up here because we had a large group and didn't have a lot of time for dinner, but surprisingly the food was pretty good, especially the calamari salad and the grilled salmon.  I guess these days every hotel in Vegas has to have a trendy Asian fusion place with groovy bathrooms.  The ones here are like really upscale porta-potties or large airplane bathrooms with high ceilings, with tiny little LCDs playing music videos.  Tao is more fun and has a cooler atmosphere, but I think I liked the food better here.
Dan Dan Noodles. Nice Chinese pulled noodles with an oily chili sauce and minced pork. These were mouth numbingly hot, but incredibly flavorful and one of most memorable dishes for me. I could have at the whole bowl on my own.
   The food is fresh / generous portions 
Jasmine was a perfect choice for a light supper after a show. Ringside seats for fountains was a bonus. Two of us shared a delicate won ton soup, an assortment of delicious steamed won tons followed by their signature chicken, asparagus ginger rice. Everything was delicious and service was outstanding
The waitress is very rude and doesn't have any customer service manners, I ask for the menu she broth it and slap it on the table, then I ask for jasmine tea and very rude said, if you want tea, first read the menu and see what we sell, didn't answer yes we have or no we don't have jasmine tea.
We ordered a maitai and hot tea for the wife, a Dr. Pepper for me, egg rolls, crab puffs, kung pao chicken and black pepper chicken.
My son and I had dinner here..  Should have gone to Subway in the same plaza.  Or Panda.  Food is OK here, but I could find 100 places I'd rather eat.
Pros - 
Good Chinese delivery!!
- Chicken Chow Mein (our choice)
The food was great! Some of it reminded me of the foods I had tried back in Singapore. I ordered the following:
China Grill was great for happy hour, but I can imagine it is somewhere I would like late night.  It's dark and sexy, with plenty of room to lounge, great drinks, and a Thievery Corporation-based playlist.  I really, really want a place like this in DC.  I will never, ever get it.
Lamb hot pot hits the spot! Don't forget the garnishes on the back wall by the kitchen.
One of my favorite restaurants in Vegas! Spot on flavors hitting all the right notes, and superb service. Though pricey it worth it!
The food itself never disappoints. They have the best sesame chicken and Mongolian beef in my opinion, my sister practically fantasizes about the crab Rangoon, and the rest of the bunch enjoy the egg drop soup. There's always plenty to go around if you do the family meal. I would expect leftovers unless you're feeding a football team.
I love eating here and have for many years.  They are receptive to leaving items out of a dish and are quite friendly.  A definite favorite place.  I frequently order Singapore Noodles, Subgum Lo Mein, and Cold Sesame Noodle.  YUM!  Best in town!  
Actually by accidently I walk in cuz I just want the yogurt next door. BUT it looks like a nice place, clean environment, and you can see how they cook in front of you.... they don't hide their "skills".... however, I still don't know how to cook   :)  
By far the worst sushi I have ever had.
Diane and I honored our late dinner reservation here right after savoring the many edible treats offered at Yelp's Night of the Living Neon on Fremont Street during Spring Break.  Thus, we were hardly hungry when we arrived at the restaurant.  So, we ordered less than we normally would, but made the dishes count.
I stopped in because there used to be a Wang's by my house and I was curious to see if it is the same. 
When it comes to quality, affordable asian cuisine...you should always think of 2 words...Asian Grill! This family owned restraunt has amazing service! Ivy the daughter is the best! She knows what it means to provide outstanding customer service and will even remember your name when you return. 
I'll be honest -  it was just ok.  The service was great - very accommodating staff but when it came to the food, I could have been eating anywhere.  Certainly nothing to write home about.
The chow mein had almost no flavor. Probably the worst chow mien I can recall having in some time or ever.
Then today was a nightmare.  35 minutes for one lunch special and some crab puffs.  This skinny, pimply woman with absolutely no handle on the English language was running around screeching "I new!  I new!" and not helping anyone.  The phone was ringing, customers were coming to the counter to ask for refills...  A little boy waiting when I was exclaimed to his father, "I don't understand anything she's saying."  Yeah, neither did anyone else.  
This is my review of 'Beijing Chinese Cuisine' (as other yelper mentioned before),,,the one right next to Sin City Sushi :P 
The food itself was quite tasty, not too salty and didn't leave us feeling bloated, greasy, or ill.
This place is conveniently located inside The Venetian Casino. We came around 8pm on a saturday evening and it was not packed...yet.  The service was not very good because the guy kept forgetting us and rushing us to order. However, once we got the order placed--the dishes came by super fast.
The egg rolls are mediocre and when you ask to substitute a crab puff, they tell you only at dinner not at lunch...... Which does not make sense as they charge 99 cents for an egg roll, but crab puffs are 6 for $3.75 or about 65 cents each. I hate wasting food and since the main course is just OK, this makes it tough not to drive down the road to Fast Food Chinese!!!!
Best Chinese food I've ever had. Great service. Prices are reasonable for the quality of the food. We had hot and sour soup, chicken fried rice, beef with broccoli, teriyaki chicken and sweet and sour chicken. It was all very delicious.
Good eats. Great value. Awesome Hong Kong style cafe.
I was pleasantly surprised with the curry chicken i had last night.  It was delicious and had pineapple chunks in it! So yum. I literally didn't want to stop eating UNTIL I found a medium sized black hair floating around in the middle of my container. Boo! :/ Nothing makes me more disguted then seeing a hair in my food. Bleh. That killed it. I understand shit happens but I just don't know if I will be back.
 Appetite aside I have something to take home each and every time and it makes for a nice snack when reheated.
I wish that their whole menu listed descriptions of the meals, what kind of sauce, what specific vegetables were in each dish, etc. Overall, great place, and if I ever want to order in again, I'll go here :)
What a wonderful discovery.
Buyers Beware!
Always enjoy the egg rolls. Egg drop soup are awesome. Kung pao chicken are good only with a couple of adjustment when ordering, easy sauce and same goes with sweet and sour chicken.
The NY style chinese is simply amazing, the quality, the freshness of the veggies and meats they simply cannot be beat. Also they have the best shrimp n chicken egg rolls in town. HW's soups are amazing,  If you're into looks and ambiance you will be disappointed. HW is better than Chinese sit down restaurants.. and without the flair. Here you get freshness, non greasy flavorful Chinese food made to order, it's a winner!
The egg drop soup is indeed the best here and I still haven't had better since moving to San Francisco.
Everything is fantastic. Try the fried chicken wings, the smashed chicken and any of their soups. All are delicious and amazing. For dessert, the lychee ice cream with mochi is nice. Also the shaved ice is fantastic.
Wahsun has definitely become a favorite of mine, and though when they choose to close early randomly, I'm sometimes disappointed, I live close by, so I can always come back another day.
just Cream Cheese?) Puffs on the way home from our kickboxing class.  Kind of defeats the purpose of the kickboxing class, I guess, except that we probably would have eaten the Chinese anyway.
For example:
Red beans and tapioca for dessert
I live all the way out by Lake Las Vegas so my delivery options are not huge but on random Chinese delivery cravings China Joe's does the job, The people on the phone are always nice foods decent noting special. Their Generals chicken is good but they put it in a styrofoam box and it's a really hot food so the box looks melted when it gets to you not a big fan of that. I'll probably order from them again, hopefully i remember to tell them no styrofoam boxes.
I am ashamed.
Whoooo-Hoooooo Hand drawn noodles are da bomb and this place didn't disappoint. 
Saw the $5.85 lunch specials (3 choices). This includes drink and is a good value I would imagine. Might try this if I decide to go back.
This place has changed management, and the food is vastly improved. Curious, I stopped by for lunch when I saw the place dubbed the "New Grand China". Quite a difference.
As stated a little pricey.
For starters, it took forever to be acknowledged. When she finally comes over, there was no smile. No friendly greeting. Just a plain face and a cocktail napkin put in front of me and a blank look. She eventually loosened up, but only after I made an effort to connect with her. Should be the other way around though. Just saying. The lady next to me with her BF asked the other bartender what was in a particular specialty cocktail she was making. Bartender looked at her and plainly said...vodka. Then walked away. Wow!!!
a.  Do you like sweet and sour pork?
I decided to call the next day. They answered, and I ordered what the New Times review suggested - crab in onion ginger sauce and some egg rolls. I drove the six miles and got it, then brought it home. 
I've ordered delivery (Egg Drop Soup. Pan Fried Dumplings. Egg Rolls and Pork Fried rice). Eaten on location (Orange Chicken. Seafood Platter). This is some of the best Chinese food I have had in this town. Between freshly made and being full of great flavors I cannot recommend this place enough.
As far as my actual meal was concerned, here are the deets:
Woo at The Palazzo would probably have been more authentic...
Hands down the best Chinese in Arizona. Food is fantastic but is a little pricey. Always leave with a happy. Great service and clean decor
Do yourself a favor an head a few miles south (past C-Fu) to China King for Dim Sum an authentic Chinese Dishes.
me: hey we're going to Diamond Chinese, you and the family in? 
Best Chinese in town!!  I dine in and pick up frequently and have never been let down!  Food is excellent and ownership is great!
Beautiful ambiance. The "jasmine experience" was a great mean. It's pricey at $108 per person but you get an amazing 5 course meal that includes Kobe beef, seabass, and much more. Be prepared to spend. It was over $450 for 4 people. Well worth every penny. My dad really enjoyed the duck.
I've been eating here for about 20 years and is my hands down favorite place in Vegas.
The service was friendly but they should really reevaluate either their portions or prices.
Great food, great prices, awesome portions. They delivered the food within the window they gave us, super friendly, the delivery guy also brought a 100 count box of tea, " stating merry Christmas." From now on this will be the only place I get Chinese food from...
Why? Because of the beef noodle soup. Tired, hungry, slightly hungover, and wanting something to satisfy the need of something homey that American food cannot, Noodle Asia was the most appropriate dining opportunity. Plus it was just downstairs in the lobby at the Venetian.
My husband and I were staying at the Monte Carlo and we were looking for something Asian to eat but didn't feel like wandering too far from the hotel. So, we decided to stop by here. We've been back twice. We greatly enjoyed the dim sum and that's all we ate there. Service was very prompt and the prices were about average for Vegas. I'd definitely eat there again. At least, I'll have the dim sum again.
Decent Chinese food if you are in a hurry. Dining room is clean and very industrial looking like Chipotle with lots of stainless steel. Prices are reasonable, service is quick, and the employees seem helpful. Good variety of Chinese favorites similar to a Panda Express, nothing exotic, food was hot and fresh. I got a large Mongolian beef for lunch and it was more than enough food for one person, added a little soy sauce and it was a good meal. I will eat here again.
Eat here occasionally.  Never had a problem with an order or the servers.  Typical asian service, quick and no small talk.  We (GF and I) come for the lunch specials, a crazy amount of food for the price.  Here's a tip, 1 full order is more than enough for 2 people, so you can really save $ and get an appetizer.  I like there sweet and sour chicken.  I wont go as far as to say that this is AUTHENTIC Chinese food, but its perfect for a typical Americans idea of "Chinese food."  4 stars all the time!
Funny thing was that i went in on 4/20 once and the owner said "remember!  4/20 today, don't party 2 much!"  
Some of my favorites are the Kung Pao and Orange Chicken. I also recently had the Bourbon Chicken, which is out of sight. If you haven't been here, check it out. Support this mom-and-pop establishment opposed to a chain like Pei Wei.
Also-- their portions are pretty big. They gave our food to us in take-out plastic containers, similar to the ones Pei Wei uses. The containers seem small, but my husband was impressed because he actually had to take some home! 
This is like Casino Royale, you can watch it just about every other day.
Okay, so I finally went to P.F. Chang's and I'd have to say it was alright.  We went there for a work function so the bill was not something I had to worry about!  Which was uber nice because I tried a few things that I normally wouldn't buy myself. So here is a run down of what I had:
The Water Boiled dishes are a famous Szechwan classic which I don't know why I haven't ordered until today.  The plain name is quite misleading.  It's a clear soup boiled with an insane amount of chilies, more numbing peppercorns, Napa cabbage, a little celery, fermented beans and garnished with sprigs of coriander.  You have choice of meat and we chose fish today.  The filets are coated with cornstarch and quickfried to preserve it's moisture and tenderness before adding to the stew.  This is by far the spiciest and most flavorful dish I've had here so far.  I think I'm hooked.
A gentleman came in after me and ordered fried rice with his meal.  After he ordered, the staff started streaming out of the kitchen to eat a family-style lunch at one of the large corner tables, bringing out their own plates of rice for themselves.  When the gentleman received his food, he let the guy know that he had ordered fried rice, but they had given him steamed.  The older woman that had been taking care of us then told him that they were 'out' of fried rice.  Total crap, am I right?  If he ordered it and it was fine then, why isn't it now?  It soon became clear when the dishwasher came out with his own plate full of fried rice to eat at the corner table with the other staff.  I almost couldn't believe it.  The gentleman didn't catch this however, so he didn't complain.  I felt bad for him.  They obviously don't care too much about it, since they didn't offer to cook him a side of it.  Oh well.
So for now it's a 3.5 stars for me and my wife.  The rest of the menu was too expensive to try out and the sushi was better than ok.
the food there is decent at best, but the management has no idea how to deal with customers and how to honor coupons that THEY themselves put on restaurant.com
Employees a few years ago were wonderful, friendly.  Staff has changed and the new manager was extremely rude.  Went back a few weeks ago and seems like things have turned around (thank goodness this is very close to my house).  Managers are wonderful and the staff great now.
We opened our take out bag and the white rice had been left off of the order...we were going to give them a pass for that...but on the flavor issue...there are no excuses...
My rule of thumb is that if you are going to eat at an "ethnic" food place, the people working/cooking there should be of whatever decent the food that is being served is, that wasn't the case here.  
Doesnt take American Express.
Fresh tender and chewy noodles. Check. 
Mongolian Beef-extremely tender cuts of beef, but the sauce wasn't sweet enough (I hate to say it, but PF Changs is better!)
First of all, i have to admit the food is really good there. The problem is the old-lady waitress. Her poker face looks like i owe her money, but that's not the problem. She changed our table and took our dishes to another one even without asking our permission, and her words were just like an order rather than negotiation. Anyway, again, fabulous food but horrible service if you're "lucky" enough to meet that waitress.
I've been here many times as we live in the area. Nothing here will really knock you out, but I do like their Walnut Shrimp. Ask for it with a light amount of sauce, otherwise it's absolutely slathered.
I'm definitely one who likes to discover new places and Dragon Island did not disappoint. Both of the women who waited on us were very helpful with suggestions, had lots of energy, and most importantly appreciative of our patronage. The restaurant was very clean and modern. The menus were current, descriptive, and believe it or not the photos actually matched what came out, lol. We had the Emperors Chicken, Almond Chicken, Pu Pu Platter, white rice and Chicken Fried Rice. All of the servings were plentiful, fresh, and great flavor without the sauces feeling to heavy. 
The lunch specials are well priced, under $6, and you get soup and egg roll.  I will most likely eat here again.
Chive Crème Fraîche
The portion for their dinner special is generous. My sis and I shared it and was enough to fill us up. 
There are a lot of good review's about this place. IMHO kinda greasy.
I ordered the Prawns with Honey Walnuts and was delighted that the dish didn't come out and the entire thing didn't tasted like mayonnaise. 
On a side note, we drove by Cathay House (another restaurant we always go to) and the Chinese name of the restaurant changed (new management?). Anyways, we took a look at the menu and they seemed to have a lot of new items that used to be on the menu at Food Express. Maybe one of the chefs from Food Express went over there? Too bad I didn't have time to go to either restaurant.
Great food! Huge, generous portions of flavorful food! Much different from other "out of the box" chinese restuarants! 1-liter of Egg Drop Soup for $1.50 that was great. I have never found a better price and honestly, top-tier quality. Be careful though! The Ma Po Tofu is darn spicy!
Chicken with green onion. - this is my all time favorite dish. Simply prepared chicken on the bone and cut up with a sauce made of minced scallions. We ordered a full order vs. half due to wanting to have some for home later. 
Great prices, diverse menu, friendly staff (some language barriers present, so speak slowly), and just yummy. 
We visited this past weekend and their service attitude completely sucked and I will not be back.  All the other times we've visited the restaurant, the restaurant is as good as any Chinese restaurant can get.  I don't expect much, but disrespecting the customers is not good.
I asked to speak with owner or manager and was told, "look nobody cares so take it or leave it".
Fresh Chinese food, good prices. This place is very similar to Pei Wei. The meal was very good. I would definitely go again.
Yo yo. I'm a true New Yorker.  Raised in Brooklyn, Forest Hills, Queens and Westbury, L.I.  I've spent time in many states across the US and would rate this joint as the closest thing to getting real NY chinese food.
We just love going there!
I've gotten takeout here twice and delivery once.  Each time, ordering was huge saga because the workers have limited English skills.  Which makes me think they have some hidden gems on their menu or off-menu.  But I don't have the patience or language skills to find out.  Delivery was super fast, which I appreciate.
I gotta admit - this was the first Chinese food place that my mom took me to and I grew up eating Happy Food... but i MUST admit... it's not that good. It's nostaliga that forces me to grant them another star. 
Mediocre Asian food made to accommodate american taste.  Ok tasting but not authentic.  Do not like the ambience but it is conveniently located very close/on UW-Madison campus.
Pricey Chinese but so worth it.
I saw them work on the dough so it seems as fresh as you can get.
I remembered seeing the sign for Mei Wei and wondered if they thought maybe they would get more business by varying their namesake by one letter to the popular chain.  Nonetheless I decided to stop in.
Come here expecting good, authentic food but knowing the waitress hates the world and that you'll have to wait to eat, even when not very busy. I'll be back for that lobster though.
TL;DR:
Love this place- the food is excellent. The delivery service is definitely spotty... But I live close enough that I drive over for pick up. Otherwise it takes about 2 hours for delivery. I still eat here at least 2 times a month. Lettuce wraps, Mongolian beef, Sesame Chicken, all favourites. If you want quality taste, and don't mind eating in the hole in the wall dining room or running to pick it up, you will not be disappointed. ;)
Let's not overlook the fact that they are open on Sunday.  That is huge for this area.  Most places are closed...  So it a bonus when you look up and find it is 6 p.m. and have not figured anything for dinner.  This place is always a good fall back!!!
This place is awesome and I wish I still lived on that side of town.  Now, it's over a 30 minute drive for me to get there.  All of their food is amazing and at such unbelievable prices.  We always order from their Hong Kong Style menu.  The service is also great.  It's family owned so you'll see the parents and grown adult kids helping out.
Go here for the food and go with my sister-in-law!  Boy, does she order enough to satisfy everyone in our party, making other diners in the restaurant envious of our meal!  
We got a complimentary cup of egg drop soup which was good.  My wife liked her chicken with garlic sauce and I liked my twice cooked pork, but it wasn't spicy.  And, during the meal, I couldn't help look at the table ahead and to my left where every dirty dish from every other table ended up for a temporary home, but they stayed there during the hour plus we were in the restaurant.  I realize it's a mom and pop operation but when there are only 4 tables, it becomes an issue.
AND THEY DELIVER.. : )
Ordered over 10 items on both the breakfast menu and the Szechuan menu. First of all, their steam buns were ready-made and re-steamed when we ordered, so taste like shui Mai.... Omg and everything comes afterwards are either too salty or tasteless.
3. Popcorn Chicken- okay, i've had a lot of popcorn chicken in my days.. but for some reason.. the seasoning on this chicken is different. Its so addicting.. I ended up eating it all before my boyfriend could even have some! He agrees as well.. theres something about their popcorn chicken that doesn't want you to stop eating it!
The food was over 20 minutes late, cold and subpar. They get 2 stars for being cheap. Will not order again with so many other places to choose from. Plenty of mixed reviews so this place must be hit or miss. It was a miss for me.
My friend got some sort of crab roll that tasted bad ... she was doubled over in pain by the end of the night.  The Philadelphia roll was o-kay.  I ordered the Volcano Roll and Spicy Tuna roll, both of which were good.  We got free edamame because of the lame service.   Overall ... less than average dining experience.
Just average service.  Made us (2people) wait 15 mins for a seat when plenty of seats were open.   Limited dim sum many so we ordered entrees.   Spring rolls were a little burned.
Great tasting food and great value - the lunch special of $5.95 can't be beat.  We dined in and had the Chicken in hot garlic sauce and the Pork in garlic sauce.  Both were fantastic and came piping hot just out of the wok!  The portion was enough for two meals and that was what we did - doggy bagged to take home.  Place is clean and service is prompt and friendly.  Will be back many times.
The soup for the seafood hotpot was much better than the lamp hotpot, but again it was loaded of MSG. 
I would absolutely eat here again.  I hope this little gem stays in business to service my Peking duck cravings for many years to come.
Love this place and love the food very much!!! Try the new dishes today!!! Excellent taste.... I got special udon today, very interesting taste, they put the cream and butter in this dish... More like American/Chinese combination dishes. Love it and will order it again
I think this place is good for families and baseball teams and such. Not a date night place unless you are taking it out to one romantic destination. I would come back to try their honey chicken which seemed a bi hit with the groups on this night.
4. Walnut Shrimp
We tried this place no long after it opened and had a coupon.  I'm always willing to try new Chinese restaurants since I can't seem to find many good ones in the Phoenix area. 
My wife vouches for their excellent entrees;  I can't.  The wait staff were so chaotic that I could only watch her eat while they ran crashing around the restaurant.  We flagged them down repeatedly, but amid frenzied prepping to-go orders and serving other table guests, they never got my order out
The Good(Acceptable):
Like I said, this is a great spot if you're looking to fill your noodle cravings... I absolutely will be coming back.
Great place to get good chinese food. The prices look very reasonable but then again...portions are a bit on the smaller side. We had to order one additional dish to get our tummies filled but all in all it was a great experience. Will definetly be back.
Now to the food...the food was also great.  Duck is what surprised me the most.  This has to be one of the most tasteful ducks i had.  It was so juicy and the flavors was amazing.  The duck skin was nice and crispy.  The kids enjoyed the crispy chicken and the Hong Kong Pan Fried Noodles had everything in it.
Good food, nice people, good prices....the father cooks, the daughter, who speaks the best English, works the register, and I am pretty sure I saw Mom sweeping up once. It's worth supporting that kind of thing, or all we'll have is McEverything.
Pan Asian Express is no Panda Express. The food quality is WAY OFF.
Oh, and next time I'll get the hot and sour soup.
We have been patronizing this place for about 10 years now and never had a bad experience! We go at least 3 times a month, so it's not luck at all.
Below par food. Wontons and Eggrolls were stale. Fried Rice had zero flavor. Probably not coming back.
  Finally, they served my entree: shrimp chop suey with fried rice and chow mien. The portion could feed two people. The shrimps were giant. No scrimping on quality here. With all the broccoli and mushrooms, I felt like I was eating healthy, instead of pigging out. The fried rice was your average fried rice. I am not crazy over the chow mien. It's like filler on what would be a great album. In all honesty, I prefer Panda Express's Chow Mien.
no, they dont have delivery but the food is definitely worth the effort of take out or dine in. i might even have to try dining without windows sometime :)
The steamed dumplings were great as well. They served a mildly sweet sauce with the pork dumplings. Honestly, the dumplings on their own are amazing. All of the dumplings were about the size of a golf ball and definitely enough to fill you up. 
Good, fresh chinese.  Unique flavor combos and you can order healthy here.  brown rice, steamed veggies, etc....
Okay, truth be told I am never satisfied with fried rice from a Chinese place because I know how to make good fried rice but most fried rice from any Chinese spot is always bland and under seasoned so I don't have much gripes when it comes to bad fried rice. I can pile on sriracha and soy sauce and make it work somehow. 
There's one word to describe this restaurant and that is BLAND.  I had such high hopes. The atmosphere is really cool, and the menu mostly sounded great but everything else was disappointing.
I have been going to Flo's for years and every single time it is AMAZING! Whenever I have family or friends in town I always take them here and nobody is every disappointed. Not only is the food exceptional so is the customer service. Flo herself stops at every table and ask how your meal was... I seriously don't understand how every single time I have been there in all times of the day she has done this. By far one of my favorite places in AZ.
Beyond that though, the food is consistently great and I have never had a terrible experience. It's not exactly fine dining but it is mouth-wateringly good Chinese food on a very small budget.
Golden Phoenix is the kind of place you visit when you want a decent, inexpensive lunch. The place is rarely full during the week, especially if you arrive closer to 11am, so be prepared to eat your meal while the (slightly creepy) waitstaff sits at a nearby empty table and watches you eat.  The food is nothing spectacular, but it's decent quality, flavorful (although "very, very spicy" is really closer to "my tongue has a slight tingle"), and dirt cheap.  Today I paid $16 and change before tip for myself and my friend, including soft drinks.  I'll keep coming back for the reasons I listed plus its close proximity to my office.  You can't beat a good deal!
I have since moved away (first to Flagstaff, then Queen Creek and now living in Goodyear) and we still make the drive at least once a month to eat here. 
Delicious.....definitely a hidden gem. They really should move closer to the strip. Tourist it's worth the drive :-)
I am back and once again I was not disappointed. Our party of 5 fortunately had reservations for the Friday dinner time. Everyone except me who was hungriest left with food from the meal. I had the Thai chicken curry at a two level of heat and it was perfect along with a Singha beer. Others ate mixed vegetable and various delicious meals with a bit more heat. Service was excellent, food out shortly after we received our drinks. Jasmine tea was a bit weak with small amount of tea in the pot ... Only complaint I heard during the meal. I have to keep this place on my list of places to stop just off Interstate 17 in Anthem, Arizona, north of Phoenix -- good to know if coming back to Phoenix from the Grand Canyon.
 Return factor: high. I appreciated the customer service. If the customer service is great on my next visit, I'll most likely become a fan and up my rating to 4 stars on an updated review.
Dragon Palace has become our go-to place when the family is itching for some Americanized Chinese food.  
I have ordered the Special Beef twice and it has been satisfactory. My boyfriend has had the orange chicken and sweet & sour chicken, both were average. There's nothing spectacular about Pong Pong, but it's not terrible either. It's easy on the wallet too.
The food isn't over dressed or fancy but it tastes good. I don't know if the people who are hating on Noodle Asia don't like Chinese food or are  just confused about the name, but it's pretty authentic.
This is my favorite restaurant in Vegas!! The food is exquisite!!! The service is amazing. It is also located in front of the hotel most beautiful fountain and it is simply a dream!!! For a date seating by the Window at night it is the most romantic place ever. Food again fulfill you but does not make you feel that you are ready for bed but to continue on and enjoy the night away!!! If you do not know what to order no worries they will recomend the best most delish dishes they have!!! Bon apetite!!!!
The best chinese restuarant in Arizona!!!!! I've visited a few chinese resturants and nothing compares to the food here! looking for some good chinese food when you are in AZ this is the place to go.
b.) Something was wrong with the food.
Came back this year and wised up, ordering a spicy tuna roll, some hot and sour soup and the chin chin bao. All of it was top notch. Their spicy tuna, especially, is among the better sushi I've ever had. I tried a little bit of other people's varieties (shrimp tempura, some specialty rolls) and they were really good, too. The Chin Chin bao? Wow. Three puffy, steamed pork buns that pack a delicious barbecue flavor, served with a REALLY spicy wasabi mustard (good if you're in to that, my spicy food loving friends tell me) and a tasty chili sauce for dipping. The buns really fill you up in a good way -- definitely enough for a meal with just them and the sushi. Had some open-faced dumplings that were really good, too. 
#82 Singapore Noodles (**** 1/2) Perfectly made... On a 6" square porcelain plate you'll receive... thin Vermicelli Noodles with Bean Sprouts, slivers of Green Onion, Red and Green Bell Peppers... stir-fried with Medium-sized Shrimp, and slivers of Chinese BBQ Pork! Smaller portion than at most Asian restaurants.
This is like a dream come true...good quality chinese food with low prices!  $5.50 for the lunch special, which comes with fried wontons, pork fried rice, soup, and I got the best shrimp with lobster sauce dish ever!  The only downfall was I wish they would include more shrimp, but other than that, this has to be one of the best chinese restaurants in town!  I have been going here twice a week because it's that tasty!
Many times Ive been here I was the only person in the place, which I don't understand, the food is really good.. Esp like the Egg Foo Young
When we called in our office order the man who answered the phone was extremely RUDE. Absolutely ZERO courtesy!! We felt rushed when ordering and when we asked what the delivery time looked like he refused to answer. We then asked again which he finally answered 45mins and then proceeded to hang up on us --- Luckily I was able to catch him before he hung up and told him he didn't ask us weather or not we wanted white rice/fried rice or egg roll/soda for our lunch special.After telling us "it comes with fried rice already" (which on the website it clearly reads that we would have a choice) he then hung up with extreme prejudice. After feeling we would have our food spat in due to this experience, we called back to cancel the order. The company I work for is based on great service and attitude, I wouldn't subjectivity my co-workers to such bad service!
I found this via a friend on Yelp. I love this place! I am so glad I went in and tried it. The food is very innovative and creative. The owner (Wendy) has been in the business a long time. I think she came up with a creative menu and I can't wait to try something different every time I go. I even ate here on my birthday! Who knew?!
The Singapore Noodles came very quickly as did the spicy stir fry.  Both were very generous portions, enough that we took some of each home. The noodles had just the right amount of curry flavor and the chicken was tender and tasty.  I'd ordered my stir fry extra spicy and I wasn't disappointed!
They have great service - greet you at the door, and are attentive when placing your order. I ordered pad Thai, which maybe was not a good choice.
The lady at the counter is always really nice too.  One time I called in and she asked for my name and she laughed and said, "You have a very expensive name."
The next time we called, we asked about the credit and they had no record of it (and did not honor it), even though they were able to pull our name and address info up with our phone number. Ok, whatever, we were hungry so we ordered anyway. The food took forever to arrive - probably over an hour. The food was quite dry and fairly cold, but my expectations for delivery are never very high. I then pulled out my Hot & Sour Soup to find that it was actually Wonton Soup. I was disappointed as I figured that at least that would be good (and I do not care for Wonton Soup), so I called to tell them. At first, the incredibly rude woman said, "Are you SURE that's what you ordered?" I said, "Yes, of course. I have never ordered Wonton Soup in my life." Then she says in a snarky tone, "Well, that's why we always read the orders back to you, to make sure it is correct." And I said, "Well, it was my husband you spoke to, but I heard him order Hot & Sour, and he says you DID repeat Hot & Sour back to him. AND, the last time we ordered from you, you also made a mistake and..." she then cuts me off "Well see, it is your fault then, it is your husband if this happened twice, and I cannot take responsibility for that!" Obviously at this point it is getting heated, and I say, "No! YOU forgot the white rice last time. There's no way that's our fault."  So this bickering goes on for several minutes until I finally say, "So are you saying you're not going to take responsibility for this?" And she responds, "No, I am not going to take responsibility." And I say, fine, I will never order from you you again." And she actually replies with "Fine." And then we both hang up!
Oh no, no-no-no-no.  How could so many things go wrong?
Meh
China Jade: worst Chinese food in the world? I don't think so.
PF Changs is your basic starter Chinese restaurant.  Food was filling enough and the waiter was pleasant and prompt.  Not sure if I would come back.....
Diamond's needs to be rated amongst authentic discount Chinese food restaurants. I give it four stars with the understanding that Diamond's is not:
The Red Wontons tasted exceptional: boiled pork wontons soaking in a soy sauce/vinegar/sesame oil/red chili oil/ garlic concoction. They were in fact so good, we devoured them in 3 seconds and promptly ordered another serving.
This place was ruff on my stomach, I got the yellow curry here.  I heard about this place on yelp because me and my friend wanted some chinese food.  
You have to try the chicken wings they r sooo good!   I recommend this place,  yes the place might be a little dirty
This is the best hot pot I've had!  I normally get the ribeye or lamb combination hot pot.  I'm sure the bowls are good for 2 people, but I can eat a whole bowl to myself.  The mini hot pots are full of flavor, spices (that I've never seen or heard of) and garlic. I cannot make the broth at home because it probably has at least 50 different spices (which makes it taste so awesome)! The portions of meat are great. Other than hot pot, this place also has great tasting congee and Vietnamese iced coffee!
Good consistent casual Chinese food at a great value. 
Maybe I went on the wong day?  I went to Wong's Chinese for the lunch special.  There was only one other couple inside which seemed awkward for the lunch hour?  I ordered the 'House Special Chicken' and although the first few bites were tasty, it had a pungent scent to it that eventually turned me off.  I asked if soda pop were available, but was told that the soda machine hadn't been working for 'a couple weeks'?  A couple weeks?  So, I'm the only person in two weeks to have walked in an asked for soda?  Again, very awkward.  The lunch was reasonably priced, however, I don't think I would return for smelly chicken and no soda.
Like Pavlov's dogs, my husband and i headed over to Miu's after we read the review in The New Times.  As many have said,  the place is in an iffy neighborhood but that never deters people like us and obviously other Yelpers either.  We entered through a door in the back located in the  parking area (as opposed to having an entrance facing the street).  Upon entering we noted that the decor was sparse if non existent (we don't eat decor!) but more importantly the place looked clean.  
Your calorie content should be criminal,
On to the food...
If you have to eat it (as I sometimes do) get it to go. I'm sure there is something on the menu worth $6-7. So I'll let you all know if I find something.
Not good. Clearly a copy cat of Panda Express. Many empty pans so I wasn't sure what I could order.  Once our orders were half fixed a call for a take out order was called in. The owner took the call while our food sat there. What happened to taking care of the money in front of your face? The copy of orange chicken is bad. The "chop chop chicken" is a chicken breast that had been sitting under a cover for too long. The crab Rangoon are a joke, only cream cheese at best. Spider webs under chairs should of been our clue. We are really in a loosing stretch lately.  We will stick to Panda Express when we are seeking Chinese fast food.
*Egg drop soup was okay but not homemade.
OK; went there for lunch again on 7/23.  We were not disappointed -- we had crispy gau gee, oyster sauce chicken over cake noodle, kau yuk, port harm har ong choi, stuffed duck, and honey walnut shrimps.  All very good and the same old fashion "Hawaiian Style Cantonese" taste.  I heard a little secret that this place might open a second location in a very, very special place that will make a lot of people super happy and the owner a lot of money.  But I don't want to let the cat out of the bag or speak too soon, so I will leave what I said at that.
So basically, if you don't like stir fry paradise, you have no soul. Plain and simple.
Lesson of the day: take a picture with the giant overpopulated fishtank and call it a day.
According to a friend of mines whom is from the motherland - China.  The food here is pretty authentic.  I will have to take her word for it and go from there.  She ordered us some basic Szechwan style dishes, which I think she took it I didn't want to go too exotic.  --- I do actually I do ---  However, there's always next time!  Pigs ear, beef tendon, duck whatever!  Please I don't mind :)  For what we ordered, I thought it was pretty good.  I tell you what though, won't ever come without my friend since she knows how to order.  I'd probably order like a gwy-lo ---  hehe.  Our server was on top of it, but I gather it's because we spoke the language -- Plus 1!  The ambience was pretty basic, but with a bunch of mandarin speaking people eating and chatting away - felt like China after all haha!  - Enjoy!
The Orange Chicken:  Good.  Better than some that I've had.  
Tried the water boiled pork. That I thought was pretty good. The meat was nice and tender. The sichuan peppercorn made everything taste lemony to me later on, including the water. I guess that must be the numbing effect people talk about. I also liked the beef with jalapeno pepper. Nice flavor. And I still really like the twice cooked pork.
I also sampled the Cashew Chicken.  The dish boasted the same attributes, but suffered from the same irremedial flaw: lack of flavor.  Oh, the portion was huge, piled with cashews, but in spite of the colorful vegetables, the thin darkly colored sauce tasted very much like the soup broth.
They raised their prices by 50% or more on some dishes & sides. Some of the prices have almost doubled. For example, the small rice was $1. Now, it's $1.50 extra. The large was $2. Now, it's $3.50.  It is something stupid but still annoying.
best dim sum you get in KW, a bit on the pricier side, but portions are huge. Fried squid is really plain, other stuff is pretty good.
Enjoy!
It's due time I write a review for this place.  I come here and pick up food twice a week.  Like others say about it, I crave it hours after I am done eating.  I always get the same thing because I love it.  The sliced beef soup.  I am not sure why.  I am not one to eat the same things all the time, however... this is my favorite meal of the past 6 months.  My wife loves the chicken stir fry.  Yesterday we tried the dumplings and they were splendid as well. 
Have had take out from this place several times. It's my number two favorite Chinese restaurant. Kung Bo and Mongolian beef were so good. hope it makes it as it seems not to be discovered yet in a strip mall.
Moving here from San Francisco where Chinese food was as common as seeing women in Scottsdale wear shorts with Uggs, I found this place to be as good as it gets for Chinese food in the Valley.
How can a restaurant with the name Food Express be deemed as one of the best, if not the best in Vegas? By having great food! I straight up asked the owner, why the name. He explained that 14 years ago when this place opened (good sign), it was like the hot thing to call a Chinese Restaurant. This idea died like pEoPlE tHiNkInG iT wAs CoOl To TyPe LiKe ThIs and Asian guys wearing baggy pants with bangs long enough to use as nun-chucks. The place lasted through this whole era, and the owner kept the name. He consider changing the name, but claimed that many people know about this place and has already been established. Sure it may attract more new people, but I guess the people that know about this place will keep this place thriving.
This has always been our favorite local Chinese take out - and especially on Chinese New Year, the special menu.  OMG its good.  We always call for takeout, one or two items and we are so close that by the time I get in the car and drive there, its done...less than five minutes.  
Ok after careful deliberation I am a fan of Tao's.. 
I was in Venetian for a quick lunch with my coworker. We were first in line to sit at the bar. However, the old lady who took our order was so rude and unfriendly that we will never go there again. She has no idea of customer service and based on her, I can only assume the  worst about staff training in Venetian. I'm very disappointed to say that I will never recommend this place to anyone.
  Will be going here from now on to get my Chinese food.
Even after our food was clearly done with plates stacked it took an additional 15 minutes for him to give us our bill.  I felt like there was no respect for my time and little care for what experience I had.
The Nee House has the best General Tso's chicken in the region, with a little twist (I think it's ginger, but i'm not certain) that sets it apart form its competition.  The General Tso's rivals its competition from the west coast and east coast.  The noodles are fantastic, with fresh ingredients and vegetables, and the eggplant and salt-n-pepper shrimp are outstanding.
Food all tastes the same. Dan Dan noodles taste like they got some dan dan noodle paste from the store and put peanut butter in it. The waitress spilled soup and continued to spill it all over even after we alerted her. She got this all over my white shirt. No tip for you.
Ok I gotta stick up for this restaurant ... Seriously people need to stop with there bitch fits... I'm glad I don't listen to others.
We got the assorted meat and shrimp with rice noodles, ginger and egg fried rice, a porridge dish (I forget which one) and the shredded chicken with rice noodles.
My husband and I came here for one of our date nights.  We ordered the jiao zi dumplings, which were delicious.  I wish we knew about the spicy mustard or other dipping sauces before eating the dumplings.  We were handed the dumplings with simply soy sauce, making the dumplings a little bland (we like some heat and extra flavor in dips normally).  The food was definitely authentic and fresh; however, the environment was a bit "fast-foody", not really inviting you stay very long.  For a quick dinner, the Dumpling Haus is an excellent option.
I have to sadly say, I didn't get a chance to try more of the menu and I imagine that had I not tried something that is so non-Chinese I would be giving this place 4 or 5 stars instead. 
Delish! The apple blossoms are different then the typical crab puffs. They are actually kind of sweet tasting. The orange chicken is amazing. Prices are average and they don't deliver. Everyone who works here is very nice.
I recently ate there with my family. I had chow fun, my daughter had chicken chow mein, husband got the sweet & sour chicken. i personally thought the food was horrible and it gave us belly aches!
some long lost hot lover I wish I had married. No. This
The House of Egg Roll is your perfect cheap Chinese food restaurant. Their service is very fast, delivery or pick-up. 
We have been ordering delivery from Miu's for quite sometime now and are slowly making our way through the whole menu. We have always been pleased with our delivery orders and have yet to be disappointed. We recently decided to venture out and dine in, we knew what to expect in terms of ambiance so we were not thrown off by it upon arrival. The restaurant was a little rough around the edges but seemed clean, the service was super friendly and the food was delicious as usual. 
In fact, I went as they had their grand opening with the thought of ordering food for the family.  As they are picky eaters, I looked at the menu.  The menu was not  as diverse as some, and knowing that some restaurants will special order food for you or modify a recipe, I asked if they could make something that was not on the menu.  Rather than saying they could not, the comment was made with a very rude tone, "My chef is an authentic Chinese Chef and what you are ordering is not Chinese, but something made up for Americans.  He won't make that."  It wasn't what he said, but how he said it and with such disdain that I will never darken the doorstep of this restaurant again.
thats all I can say.
I am sure I can't say enough.... What an AMAZING dinner!  There were 4 of us, nice table, but the food was OUT OF CONTROL GOOD!  Had the Spicy Shrimp, Seared Scallops, Fried Soft Shell Crab....can I tell you I wish I could dine there ALL THE TIME!
After about 9 months it's back and ready to serve some of the best Chinese food in town. I've yet to venture to the part of the menu that offers duck, but I've tried several beef, chicken and pork dishes and I've never been disappointed with anything I've ordered. My current favorite is the orange beef. Slightly sweet and a bit spicy, it's cooked golden and crispy and makes my tongue extremely happy. 
This is a good Chinese restaurant located on Portobello High Street, I have only come here once, but I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and the staff were very friendly. I cycled to Portobello from the city centre with my friend and we both agreed that no matter what we ate, no matter how stodgy, it could be justified, because we would have burnt it off by the time we had cycled back.
Noodles. Very filling but a little dry and not as flavorful 
1. What color is the sweet and sour sauce? (It shouldn't be red.)
But honestly, aside from the prices being so expensive, the food was actually delicious. Our orders arrived pretty fast...within 7-10 minutes after we placed our orders and there were still a lot of people at the restaurant. 
Our food came super quick, which is awesome when you have little ones. We got the boba teas for desert and we were full and happy. We still had left overs, even with the two dishes and 1 app. Oh, and the bill was awesome, around $25. Can't beat quality food for that price. We had good quick service too. Totally happy, we'll be back :)
--mongolian beef is beaten and squishy, again poor quality.
When you first walk in, you'll notice the place isn't much to look at. As most of you foodies know, never judge a book by its' cover! We were warmly greeted and we sat down to review the HUGE menu. They offer your run of the mill Pan Asian cuisine but then they offer various authentic dishes that will make you melt! 
The food was waaaaaaaaaaaay sub par and the portions borderline unacceptable. There were no people in line before or after us and all the little food bins were virtually empty. I appreciated that they offered to cook 2 of our orders up fresh, but when we received them it was about 1/4 cup of each item, if not less - and the veggies were too crisp (raw) to even bite into them. We expected to at least be able to eat the rice and noodles, and both of them tasted oily and undercooked. No bueno.
I live in the neighborhood across the street from this place, and so I've driven past it for a good year and a half. I had ordered from them a few months prior, but that was just wonton soup so I decided to go back and try the food. I got one of the lunch specials - sweet and sour chicken - and for $6 it was a TON of food. I don't know what they put in the brown-colored rice but it was AMAZING. I had enough left over for another meal (I could have eaten all of it then but I had to force myself to stop so I didn't hate myself later haha) With the lunch special you get the main dish, and then two huge sides of rice and those little cream cheese wonton things. I placed my order over the phone and they gave me a reasonable time frame. I like that they have a drive through for order pickups, because I can just see this tiny parking lot being a nightmare during busy times. 
Good Mongolian Beef.  Restaurant was clean.  Good prices.
I don't know how they are still open.
Reminds me a lot of Panda Express.  It was decent food, the service was good, and I would go back.  They are set up like panda, they have a lot of the similar items, unfortunately no brown rice.  The restaurant it's self is very clean.  It's in a great location too, lots of stuff in the immediate area.  Check it out!
Best Chinese in Las Vegas? Worth a drive across the valley? Probably not.
I had the Mongolian beef and I really liked it.  I had the lunch special, good price, so I also had their egg roll and crab puff.  It was all really good.  Our office ordered so we received free pot stickers with the larger order, we all enjoyed them.
The place is an EPIC Fail.
The spicy string beans were good, but a little bit overcooked. The Mao po tofu was delicious. The walnut shrimp was right on, delicious, and rivals some of the Chinese restaurants that I've been to in NYC, San Francisco, Taiwan, and Hong Kong.
My daughter was sent to pick up some soup after visiting urgent care across the parking lot.  They charged my daughter  for hot mustard.  I can't believe they would take advantage of a child.  will a NEVER patronize this business again.  Shame on you Cook On Wok.
We used to come here frequently for years. But since Gary is not there anymore, the quality of the food is getting worse and worse. I called the same dish any time I went there. Sometimes it was good, sometimes it was bad, and sometimes it was pretty disappointinng. The quality of the plate depends on what they have in the kitchen.
The final nail in the coffin was the price. £44 for poor food, poor atmosphere and a queasy feeling. Not ideal. I would recommend Hot Hot to no-one.
We ordered so many things, I don't remember it all. All I know is that it was all good. Family style dining at its best! In particular, I enjoyed the Minute Chicken Cake Noodle and the Hong Kong Style Pan Fried Noodle (that one is an old favorite of mine and it's been years since I've had a well-made plate of it). I guess it makes sense that a Noodle Palace would serve up tasty noodle dishes. Anything less would be uncivilized.
Okay the crepes here are not quite as nice, but it's a decent replacement. Besides the crepes, they also have soy milk, beef noodle soup, ji dan guan bing, rou jia mo, lamb skewer and much more. During my brief stay here in Waterloo I visited this place 3 times, and everything I tried was pretty good (and cheap). 
The only complaint I have is that the rice came out in an uncovered bowl, which meant it got a bit dry as it sat there, which was kind of annoying but not a big deal. 
Just remember they cook to order so make sure you call ahead to place your order. But if you are just 15 mins later than the time your order is ready be prepared to wait because your order has been served to someone else! They don't play! If they say it will be ready in 10 mins, be there in 10 mins!
8 Value
So delicious! I loved everything! I have no clue why anyone would say anything negative about this place.  I will for sure go back.  The dumplings are a must have! Don't let the negative reviews stop you from eating here.
My bf and I shared the red wontons and the szechwan beef noodle soup. I'm usually not a fan of wontons or sour-ish soups but both were pretty dang delicious. It had just the right amount of spiciness to really hit the spot! I'm sure it tastes even better after a long night of clubbing. I also tried some of my cousin's sausage fried rice and it was really good too! It's a little overpriced for Chinese food but hey, what isn't overpriced in a hotel in Vegas, right?
Very good place to eat. Get your name on the list as it is a long wait.  They don't take reservations.
The food here is really tasty. I have ordered from this location probably a dozen times now. Sometimes my order is not correct when it arrives (different items, lack of rice, something like that), but as far as preparation, speed, and taste, I am a fan. If you are thinking of eating in the dine-in section, prepare yourself for a busy, crowded, informal little space. It's more like eating at fast food than an actual restaurant. The delivery is incredibly fast and friendly, and other than the occasional incorrect order, I have always enjoyed the experience.
Place was clean and we were offered water or a drink while waiting for our takeout.
Noodle Asia reminds me of the 24 hour cafes located in California.  After a night out for drinks you need some grease!  Noodle Asia has all the classic Asian dishes from Shanghai, Black Peppered, Fried Rice, and Dim Sum too!  Needless to say, this place doesn't play around when it comes to Chinese food.  Tab bit overpriced in my opinion for what you get simply because the protein almost drowned out by the carbs.  Granted I enjoy my carbs, just not too much.  Also, is it me or do I need to drink a lot of water after a meal here?  I guess what I'm trying to say is that it's salty!  Guess that goes well for the "American" diet.  
Service is top notch. You would think you're at a full service sit down restaurant. Waiters will constantly check to see that your drinks are filled and empty plates are taken away.
For the price, it's excellent. Now that Lychee Inn is gone from the area (tears, tears, tears), I'm having a hard time finding Chinese food nearby that's better than this at any price. So far I've had the egg foo young and General Tso's chicken, and both were great.
The beef with pea pods was tasty. Beef was soft. This dish needs to be eaten at the restaurant. Does not serve well as a take out  (pods wilt)
You can ask for cups and get your own water from the pop machines.  Sure saves some $ that way.  Better still, order a cheap drink from the casino and then bring the drink to your table.
After reading all of the great reviews on this place, my roommate and I had to try. I was skeptical because I believe it's hard to distinguish great chinese food. Most of it tastes the same to me. Now after visiting Red Dragon I realize how ignorant I am. It was fantastic. Yes it's in a crappy strip mall but it's not made to eat inside, it's takeout all the way. I got the pan fried dumpings (amazing, fluffy and the inside tasted real!.) I also got the wonton soup which was cheap and delicious. It wasn't chewy like most places and was piping hot. For my entree I got the sweet and sour chicken. The chicken was fluffy breading but also crunchy and the meat was cooked absolutely perfect. Not to mention they give you a ton of food so it's well worth the value. My roommate went with the general tso's, crab rangoon and another dish I couldn't tell what it was but he loved it and he's a graduate of culinary school. The great reviews are correct, this is the best takeout around!
I will definitely eat there again!
We opted for a more carb-free version and shared this between 6 people:
*Reservations are a must.  If you end up waiting, you can always get a "massage" next door.
The man said that they cannot give us that price, he didn't even explain why.
Wynn was my favourite until this incident happened.  I wouldn't recommend this place if you are looking for good service with safe food.
Right off the bat I want to admit that when it comes to Chinese food I'm spoiled. I've traveled to Asia number of times, eaten a lot in San Francisco, and explored the Chinese restaurants in Phoenix for a lot of years. I have learned to expect a more "authentic" type of Chinese food--the type of place that is frequented by actual Chinese people.
* We didn't order it this time, but definitely try the Baked Pork Chops with Chef Sauce... It is to die for!  A perfect combo of sweetness and crunch that I can't get enough of.
Wow, this place has been here for 25 years. How had we not been here before? 
Gross!! I tried it cuz I woke across the street but OMG... dry ass food... I wanted to puke!!
Unfortunately nothing really stood out to me. The fried rice was pretty blah-zay. The Orange Chicken I got with my lunch special was good quality chicken, but over battered and the breading dominated the flavor. The egg drop soup was probably the highlight of the meal as the broth was really tasty and there was a generous amount of egg in there. The service was really good as I chatted with one of the ladies in there while waiting for my food. My order didn't take much more than 5 minutes to come up which is a touch concerning considering they don't serve their food buffet style like Panda Express. It's almost like what I ordered was precooked, warmed up, and boxed. Really a 2 1/2 star review, but I'll round up in this instance. 
a lamb with bell pepper dish- 8/10.  Wish I knew what it was called.
We only go here if absolutely, positively...necessary. My partner ordered the Mongolian beef last night and he said there was a lot of gristle in it. I don't know about you but that kind of turns my stomach. The spring rolls are fine and the lo-mein is passable. Just plan on taking your order out as the kids they have working the front are none too friendly. I went to the restroom and the bathroom had several small live and dead roaches in it. I had to make sure I got out of there as quickly as possible before one of them crawled on me! I don't know about you, but if a restaurant has a nasty bathroom, it says volumes about the kitchen. I do not want to come back here. Shame, considering they kind of make up their own hours and stay open sometimes until 2:30am.
We ordered take out and drove out of our way to pick up and it was just as good.  FYI since the noodles are homemade they can get sticky if you don't eat them right away.
Their hot and sour soup is delicoius and I've found myself craving it on many ocassions.
well, the ambiance is nice.  we sat in a private room where we were surprised at the noise control.  We were less than 20 feet away from rows of slot machines, yet we couldn't here any of it... just the soft restaurant music.  
We will be back for sure to try more items on their menu.
Unfortunately it was a little hard to determine what was actually vegetarian so I just ended up with a very simple noodle dish.. but all my meat eating friends left very happy.
Beef Egg Foo Young - The beef and gravy was ok but the veggie egg platters a little on the burnt side.  
Also, the portion sizes are ginormous. We payed $45.13 for our order, but we'll get at least 6 meals out of it [or 3 for the boy and i each
2.  Orange chicken - I usually do not like orange chicken but I really liked the flavor here.
The fried rice had egg in it..... what???? I've been here how many times and this is the first time egg ever slipped into the fried rice haha. 
We ordered the Pad Fried Dumplings(Gyoza), Braised Baby Bok Choy, Mapo Tofu, Beef Noodle Soup and Pan Fried Pork Pancakes. None of these dishes were spectacular. The Bok Choy was okay, the gyoza were very small and the quantity was pitiful. The highlight was the Beef Noodle soup, it was good and the chunks of beef were nicely braised. The mapo tofu was terrible, nothing like what it's supposed to be. 
The food itself is very darn tasty. The shredded noodles are thick, filling, and delicious especially with beef. I have gotten beef tripe stew here and it was awesome; it felt like I was eating Asian menudo and that's a great feeling.
We have been going there for over 20 years, and this review is 20 years overdue.
 Hubby got sweet and sour chicken with a mound of fried rice.  The sauce was on the side so it didnt get mushy in the container.  The egg rolls were egg rolls and not little greasy spring rolls.  And nothing was greasy.
My third and last visit 2 stars. 
Came here after partying wanted some noodle soup to cure the buzz!  Food is pretty good but prices are expensive (but in fairness your eating in the Venetian Casino.) Ordered Szechwan beef noodle soup ( the beef is super tender and there like chunks not strips of meat. The orange chicken is tasty it's not battered and they use chicken breast.
A helpful tip here: Most of the meals are large enough to share between 2 people, they're seriously big.
I would recommend these places if you want the real deal (in no particular order)
I must preface my review with the caveat that I have relunctantly adjusted my standards for Chinese food since moving to the Valley...
We had the hot and sour soup, Szechuan Chicken, and Sesame Tofu.  The hot and sour soup was okay, but a bit bland.  Both the Szechuan Chicken and the Sesame Tofu came with many more vegetables than I expected (broccoli, onions, carrots, zucchini) and they were very fresh.  The Szechuan Chicken was supposed to be spicy and it did have somewhat of a kick.  The Sesame Tofu came too sweet for my taste and definitely called for some heat (fortunately, I always have my sriracha handy).  The portions and prices were average.
The menu is pretty good too. I love how they have a chinese version menu also and you just might have to ask which is what sometimes.  Most of all, I always look forward to the free dessert they give you in the end. It's a different dessert everyday and its usually served as a hot dessert soup. My favorite is the red bean soup with the tiny glutinous rice balls, ( like tiny clear boba bubbles ) swimming in my soup. Tastes fabulously delicious.
Temporarily we are TOTTless.  Sadness prevails the Valley and all is out of order.  We eagerly await the re-opening in a new location BUT...Hurry. We have begun relying on Pei Wei to fill the void!  *Sniff* ...
first i checked yelp and saw 3-4 stars based on 6 reviews. i figured sketchy, but with such a glowing review from Pierre i figured it must be good. umm. no.
They brought the same thing again.  Apparently, according to them, chow mein does not have any noodles besides a crispy noodle.  I lived in San Francisco for 10 years, went to numerous Chinese food restaurants, and every time I ordered chow mein, it had noodles.
Only good part was the awesome Mt. Dew they had on tap.  
All in all I give this place a decent reating and a good deal for a 7 dollar lunch and it came with a large drink.
That said, the place feels homey, but the food does as well.  Now, if you're in the mood very ultra America-Chinese, it's great, but if you are looking for strong flavors you'll be disappointed.  The food might best be described as a fresher version of a Chinese buffet.  The food is always fresh, but it is nothing special.   It is less Asian in many regards then Pei Wei.  It panders very much to our sugar obsessed society, but when Asian food can be so varied with savory and sours it's just too bland for me.
Guessing I will just give up on my search and have to fly into NYC or California for a plate, thank god I am a flight attendant and can do so! 
- Picture is deceiving. It's like a big-mac ad. portion is way too small for 6. 
Two Words.. Panda Express. OK 4. With handmade noodles. Not my thing!
Oh, and one more thing.
We have tried every Chinese food restaurant in the Northwest Valley...for the last 10 years, this is by far our favorite.  We especially like the value of the lunch specials.
I am addicted to their Mango crapes and egg custard with mango and coconut milk!
  At the crossroads of Boulder Highway and Lake Mead Parkway (I-215 east of US 95) and near a Walmart Super Center, it was jumping. The abundant seating and pleasant environment did a good job of making me relaxed in a busy restaurant.
I stumbled upon this place for lunch and was surprised how inexpensive the lunch menu was. 
Loav dees pless
Tip #2 Fried Rice as part of their breakfast menu
I tried a few of the dishes such as the lo mein and the sauteed chicken with mushrooms and snow peas.  They're good but pretty pricey for what you get.  The service is efficient and friendly, however.  The interior decorating is standard neo-Chinese restaurant American-style with the pagoda theme and gilded Buddhas.  
Anyway, my coworkers got completely different food than I, so I can't speak for them about the taste of their food, other than to say that all 3 of us had bubble guts after eating our food. We spent the next few hours taking turns in the restroom.
Still, it's a staple of Americanized Chinese cuisine and is helpful in getting your order to the right total cost so you don't have to pay a "delivery fee". 
If you enjoy real good Chinese food, this is the one you should try.
I drove all the way home, you know across the street, because I was $2 short. Only to find out once I returned it was simply a miss-communication and my bill was $27 not $37. Either way when the lady counted out $35, she should have not let me leave. They were very apologetic. The food indeed made up for it. 
two types of rice, two types of meat and noodles.
Slushies and Thai Tea
The prices are pretty average for dinner though the lunch specials are great deals for filling meals.  It is typically only $7 or $8 for a meal including a bowl of soup, fried rice, egg roll, and an entree (for lunch) and about $10 or so for an entree for dinner and steamed rice (not including soup, egg roll, or fried rice though).  I typically order Mongolian beef, sesame chicken, or chicken with broccoli (or vegetables).  All are great!  
But onto food and drinks: whatever I drank was strong.  And tasty.  I had three of them and I was way more than tipsy.  Kelly enjoyed her appetizers, but I don't like anything on the appetizer list.  I tried ordering an option from it, and was just not a fan.  However, go for the atmosphere and the drinks.
It took coming to this place to finally write a review for yelp. I've yet to really find a place that really amazed me enough to write a review until I came here. 
Those delicious chicken wings
WORST SERVICE  in east valley. I mean really worst.
- Come with a coupon and experience fine dining with fast food flavor!
Order: Spicy crispy pork, Chow mein, and Crab puffs. 
Also, I think we'll be getting CHINA JADE instead of Domino's for games now, because China Jade is pretty good and delivers and Domino's is not quite as pretty good but delivers.
Just had take-out from here. We ordered online and the order took about 25 min to be ready. We ordered LG mongolian beef, veg. lo mein, crab rangoon total of $23.35 - sounded like a lot to me at first but when the order came SO MUCH FOOD! OMG we had left over for everything (for 2 of us) they also give you those lil crispies you dip in the red sauce, gave us 2 eggrolls. We could have been more than full even w/out the crab rangoons but all was delicious! I'd definitley come back. 
Ask what chinese greens they have. They usually have a bunch that aren't on the menu.  Order steamed with garlic. Chinese broccoli, ong choi, gai choi, bok choi are my faves. Order with black mushroom if you're feeling freaky.
Update 2/12 - This place has hit the skids = The last 2 times I have been there it was for lunch and the majority of the buffet was empty. Now granted both times it was busy, but that no excuse. If I wanted to only eat steamed brocoli I'd save myself the trouble and stay at home. I say fool me once SHAME ON YOU, Fool me Twice SHAME ON ME....I wont be back again and instead will go to BUFFET @ ASIA where they have NEVER failed to come through!!
Ming's isn't a fancy Chinese Restaurant, and it really doesn't try to be particularly authentic, but it does a good job of being the local takeout Chinese-Canadian place.  The takeout service is fast and friendly, and since it is close to my workplace it's pretty convenient too.  The last time I came, however, I tried to eat in, which was a bit of a mistake.  The portion was a bit smaller than usual and it took forever as takeout order after takeout order came before my eat in order...
Turns out chocolate milk and kung pao sauce get along like leather daddies and mountainbike enthusiasts; amicable yet jarringly indifferent. 
3.5 stars. the bf LOVES this place and kept recommending it "it's so delicious; best, super authentic beef noodle soup; my friends and i all love it " but then again - what does he know? 
Well, he was cool until, he asked, "All this food for you?" Yes. It was all for me. Clearly he couldn't take a hint by my condition. Oh well. He was still really cool. I lied to him BTW. I told him, it was for me and my friend. So he gave me two sets of chopsticks.
Pretty good authentic Chinese food in the nicer part of Phoenix area.  Quick service, literally.  You place your order and it comes out in 5 minutes, but it's hot and delicious.
My chicken was ok... But it was a lot of breading and the sauce was too sweet. There are better options in Madison
And to the night staff of this establishment - you should be reprimanded or fired for your carelessness. He's pointed out after reading the recent reviews that he's not the first to get sick for your simple minded laziness and low self standards.
The hot and sour soup smelled incredible, but sadly didn't live up to its scent.  I added some salt, but it didn't really help it out.  This being said, it's much better than almost all other hot and sour soups I've had around here.  The orange chicken was white meat and somewhat dry.  The sauce was okay, not too much flavor there either.  The spring roll wasn't bad.  
A single star for service, because our waitress was quite sweet and friendly. 
The woman who works here speaks broken English and is really sweet and friendly. She gave me a frequent diner card - for every ten hot pots bought I'll receive one free.
AWFUL.
This place is great tasting and beautiful inside! Great service every time. I get the combination lo mein each time I go and it's wonderful and full of flavor! It's huge and you get alot of noodles, which I like. This is a complete gem found in a strip mall that can be easily overlooked. Please check this place out! Such a great idea when your not in the mood to get all dressed up, but want the ambiance of a nice dining experience!
First, there were more garnishes than actual dish. Lots of water chestnuts, but not so much shrimp. Lots of peanuts, but very little mongolian beef. The brown rice was so hard, it was almost as if it was half-cooked. The chow fun was bland and uninspired. Nothing to write home about.
Biggest regret is moving to awahtukee I cant get my gold chef fix as often as I used to. This is totally a family run little restaurant and the owner is so freaking sweet. She always greets with a huge smile and makes the place fun to visit she has a great sense of humor... on to the food its well priced NY Style chinese food that I dare say is better than some local places that are actually in Ny. I have yet to order something off the menu that I didnt like its all so yummy.  When I buy a house I hope its next to Gold Chef!
Worst Chinese food I've ever had.  The Orange Chicken was coated in a thick sticky goo.  The Teriyaki Chicken was fatty and tendony, and the Egg Foo Yung was no good.  The fried rice had no egg or vegetables and the fortune cookie was stale.  The only good thing on any of our three plates was the noodles (which also had zero additions, just plain noodles.)  If I ever had to eat here again, I'd try a Lo Mein meal.
I decided to reach for the Egg Flower Soup (instead of my keys), & back at the table, it was good.  Serverita showed up, was friendly, & also agreed to turn down the TV, so I began to warm up to the place.
I ordered the half portion of sake marinated "drunken" chicken (ponzu sauce, sweet crispy onions and Asian slaw). My dish was incredible - the chicken was crispy on the outside and tasty on the inside and I devoured the crispy onions and the Asian slaw. 
Vegetable Bean Curd Soup
Also, the full entrees are gigantic for the price. Highly recommended if you're going to pay for a Dinner Combo--just make the upgrade, it's worth the extra pound of food you get.
No too bad, not too good. It's right around the corner from where I live and they deliver.  I'd get it again but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there or order in.
Chicken Lo Mein - fine, but unremarkable.
I am inclined to agree with the previous reviewers. This place isn't bad by any means, but it also lacks anything to make it stand out from the crowd of similar restaurants dotting the area. 
Not bad but not tooo good either!!
Let me start with the decor - It is modern. It is attractive. It is bright inside. It is goldfishy. Some of the fishes are upside down (they look dead, really!) but still breathing. Umm, is it just me that think that is cruel?
Notice a lot of the pictures are from 3 years ago. Apparently they used to have some great chef who left. Secondly all the pictures are from the same person who has only written one review that's glowing about this "restaurant". I wonder if that's the owner... Don't let those photos and the old good reviews fool you.
We were looking for Chinese near our house and didn't want the so-so buffet down the street. I had tried this place before, but only for a light snack while my tire was being fixed. It looked intriguing enough that I kept it in the back of my mind for quite a while. Unfortunately, the decor kept me from rushing back (I don't have many adventurous foodie friends).
I got the house special chicken, Mongolian beef, and small wonton soup.  All of them are piping hot, fresh, and delicious.  This is my go to spot for Chinese now and they very much deserve the business.
The owners and very friendly and attentive. The chinese food there is far above average (at Madison level) but not best in Town. The price was fair for the taste of the food.
I am a true hot pot fan especially in winter season. Me and my family love to come this place just for their spicy Chinese herbal hot pot. They offer 3 different combos, such like beef, lamb and seafood. What I love the most about this herbal hot pot is the broth. The broth comes with chinese herbs like dong kwai, goji berries, plum, longan, star anise, clove, and loads of whole garlic. You will feel all warm up after drinking the soup. And remember to try their red wonton when you visit! They are very delicious too!!
Food was luke warm and the string beans were very wilted.
If you don't live anywhere near this place, don't worry as they offer a home delivery service. You can also pay by card if your bill is more than £7.
Inside is painted pink of all colors and has several cheesy pictures of koi and other Chinese items on the walls. There are booths and some table with chairs and you can usually sit where you want.
anyway, i give props to the waitresses though. they work hard!
Red Won Tons.... Spicy...Not for white people
OJ chix is ok but the soy drenched not fried rice ruined it!
I want to like the food at Shanghai, I really do, but I just don't.  The lettuce wraps are good if you load them up with sauce, but their other entrees are just okay. Hardly any veggies in their entrees. Tonight the Terriyaki chicken was dry & overcooked, the Honey Chicken was mushy, not crunchy on the  outside (it is fried). They have driven me to cook my own Chinese food.  I'm just from cities that had great Chinese restaurants. Hopefully they will change some of their recipes.
My family is from Hunan so I was feeling a little homesick and missed my Granma's cooking. I brought people who don't really eat spicy food so the flavor will not be in it's truest form. In China we have 4 main regional cuisines, "Xiang" is from the Hunan province. It's often confused with Sichuan cuisine which features a different style of peppers and form of spiciness. "Xiang" cuisine is spicy, fragrant pepper, hot-peppery, fresh taste with sour spicy taste, it is an immediate reaction to flavors. The spiciness practically combusts on your taste buds. Essentially speaking if you're planning to eat this, you're going to sweat!!! The only authentic dish I ordered was the Duo jiao pepper fish head, the server insisted on whole fish so it's duo jiao pepper whole fish. It's steamed and the flavors is something you can't find anywhere else. Order this dish and you will have a decent understanding in Xiang cuisine. My friends ordered the Mapo tofu which is of Sichuan cuisine so that was just mediocre. We ordered a pork and pepper dish but the spiciness level was toned down to nothing so the flavors were missing. Finally, the thinly sliced vinegar stir fry potato was pretty epic. What I would recommend is if you can't handle spicy make sure you advise the staff but they will tone it down to where you won't really grasp all the flavors the cuisine has to offer. The venue is nothing fancy, it's simple, there is a flat screen that plays KTV videos. Did I mention peppers speeds up your metabolism? Another great reason to try this style of cuisine.
We have Chinese national friends and they all claim it is a great place for authentic Chinese Szechwan.  
Not Open on Sundays :/
I like the fact that you can watch them hand pull noodles towards the front of the restaurant by the entrance. They also have several fish tanks that adds a splash of vibrant color from the otherwise contrasting white decor.
The sauces were a bit on the salty side---had to return a couple dishes back for the over use of salt...The rest was doable but nothing exceptional.  I didn't take notice of any frozen veggies being used, but it wouldn't surprise me...Times being what they are, everyone tries to cut corners...on the other hand, the price charged for our large group was reasonable, the decor was fine, and the location had plenty of accessible parking and felt safe.
_________________________________________
The great thing about my experience at least was our $20 restaurant coupon. Don't let the prices discourage you though. If you want fresh sushi with a different twist, i suggest you check this place out.
Stopped by to pick up a quick meal. Ordered the alluring on photo Hong Kong Chow Mein and gravely disappointed. It's mainly veggies, noodles and meat mixed together...that's it. Was I expecting too much?
Been coming here for a few years, 2-3x weekly. I've tried pretty much everything and it's all good, although I generally go with my favourite combo lo mein. The front of the house is clean, but the restroom is... well, it kind of calls Silent Hill to mind. Prices are reasonable and the staff are all friendly and competent.
I eat chinese a lot and whenever I am on business trip, I always try chinese.  Now this is what Chinese food should be! top notch! I tried their hot and sour and chicken with garlin sauce.  it is by far the best chicken with garlic sauce ever.  i am definitely going back there tomorrow.
2/5 standard chinese.
This is in no way authentic and I bases on my experience it was barely good on a Sunday night. But maybe that's because I forgot to pray over it since I was so hungry. Only Pro: it helped me stay on my diet.
All in all, barring the wontons, I would go back there to get food if I was in a hurry. Better choice than Panda Express or any of the other chain chinese food stores.
My lomein was average nothing special. My dinner partner was disappointed with the lack of being able to pick and chose items for her meal. 
I've been here many many times and it is the only Chinese restaurant that I go often and crave for in the valley. The most often ordered dish on our table is the spicy chicken with bones, you might think it's crazy for the first time because almost half of the plate is cover with red chili, but that's why it tastes so good!!!!!
Red 8 is quite possibly the best Chinese restaurant in Vegas. It is located in the Wynn and is spectacularly designed as the hotel is. The hostesses are always friendly and walk you themselves to the table. The foods impeccable. We always get the shrimp Chow Mein ($24) and and tried the Sweet and Sour Chicken tonight ($19). Both dishes were so delicious. The Chow Mein does only have 4 shrimp but it's Vegas so that's expected. The Sweet and Sour Chicken is plentiful and so good. The soft drinks are $4. This particular night we didn't have the best waiter but usually they are very attentive and helpful. I would definitely recommend this restaurant when you come to Vegas. It is totally worth the price.
Service- 1 out 5
Don't look for anything too fancy here... It's really like a cafeteria where you order and pick up your food and go sit down at an empty table to eat afterward.
Love this place feel like I'm back home in New York when I eat here. Usually get boneless spareribs with pork fried rice, or chicken and broccoli with pfr.
I was surprised to find this place so good. The restaurant itself was small, but the food was pretty good for the price. We had the salmon and an eel sushi box, while a friend of ours had the teriyaki shrimp. For an appetizer we had an order of crab rangoon and it was pretty yummy.
My friends and I used to go to China Way at least two to three times a week. All of a sudden, change of management. New menu, raised prices. Was kinda expensive before, but food was great and old owners and management were good people. Younger management, maybe their Daughter or Niece started changing everything. I haven't been back for at least two months. New management totally wrecked what the old owners worked so hard to build. Myself and all of my friends will not go back until they change the price back to the lower amount it was before. Last time I was there, I mentioned the raised prices and I probably wouldn't be back. New management didn't seem to care. Meantime, we have found another great Chinese restaurant close by.
Excellent service,great staff. Feel very welcome every time I eat there. Thet have memorized my favorites.
I live less than a mile from food this good and I didn't know about it for 8 months until I looked up Chinese food on Yelp. I mourn for the lost time!
Between my wife and I, we've pretty much sampled the menu and found everything good.  I especially enjoy the barbeque duck but everything is good.
My last thought, we should of ate next door at Los Fav taco shop.
Food Poison that what I got when I went to eat here, Food was very poorly cook and taste was horrible. 
Their hot tea is mediocre but again, their staff sucks.
We went in and had the dinner specials that comes with soup, egg roll, Rangoon and a piece of fried shrimp. We had the orange chicken, beef broccoli, sweet and sour chicken and ma po tofu. Everything was excellent and very well priced.
Out of all of the Chinese restaurants that deliver to my house, this is my favorite.
Honey walnut shrimp - it was crispy and smothered in mayo sauce making it ultra creamy. Yet, I think it was missing something. It felt very one noted in the flavor department and I felt overall that it needed more seasoning to bring it all together. It's certainly not the best honey walnut shrimp I've ever had, but it passes as good. 4/5
Pan Fried Noodles [Beef & Seafood] - Both selections were pretty good.
Now, moving on to the actual food, which is among the most authentic Szechuan cuisine (along with Fugu) in all of Madison. 
   Don't miss out on this spot! Support our local independent businesses. If you are staying at the Holiday Inn across the street from this restaurant, and you are reading this review debating whether or not you should go, I'm telling you now....Go to Shango for lunch!!! If you are a local, stop dragging your feet and make your way over to one of the best lunch spots in town.
The dim sum is just "ok" nothing for me to write home about. The one dish that I really liked was the chinese broccoli cooked with garlic sauce. Yum yum yum.  It's in a big bowl, not oily, not saucy, just really good. I think it's $7.50.  
Meat= Flavorful, nicely seasoned. Expertly cooked.
We are sad, this was our go to Chinese delivery. Now we must take on the task of finding something new.
If you can't understand the concept above, go eat at Panda Express or PF Chang and enjoy your Sweet and Sour Chicken.
I've read all the positive reviews and was totally excited to try this place today.  We've been craving really good Chinese food that would satisfy our spoiled pallet from Cali.  "Inexpensive, great food, nice service"...sounded nice...
My husband ordered the moo soo pork,  I didn't like it and thought it was too salty, but hubby liked it.  
Great service, wonderful meal the honey glazed shrimp is a must have. You can also never go wrong with the crab rangoons for an appetizer
Pretty average stuff.  I was hoping for better.
                 Beef Tenderloin in Black Pepper Sauce
Horrible food. Frozen, fried, poisonous. I ate a salad and Buddha's feast and still felt like my brain and body went into chemical override that didn't leave till the next morning. I went because I had a gift certificate but severely regretted not just throwing the GC away. The fish tasted grainy and old, the other stuff tasted freezer burned. Just gross. Not food. . . yuck. 
I've only tried a handful of Chinese restaurants in Surprise and Big Buddha is by far my least favorite. I ordered the beef chow fun and garlic chicken on Saturday night and both were sub-par. 
First time here tonight. Really impressed with the decor and atmosphere of the restaurant. We were greeted right away and sat down. The staff was a little slow for a Friday. I think they got short handed.
So, if I live in Edinburgh and when I have a serious dumpling craving and have no where else to go, I can see myself just have to suck it up and pay it cause I'd have no choice.  But certainly, not a fan of Chop Chop for high-priced, decent dumplings.
Usually my instinct is right, but I am more than happy to say it was wrong this day.  Mr. Random Guy gave me some excellent advice because the Tomato Egg Noodle Soup was amazing.  The broth had a lot of flavor from the tomatoes, egg, and soy and it worked great with those yumtastic homemade noodles.  I slurped it down and smiled contently while hoping that my husband wouldn't want to steal them from me.  He did.  My husband isn't a big fan of eggs and even he gobbled up this delicious soup.
If you think you've arrived at a warehouse and might get mugged in the parking lot, you know you're about to have an amazing meal.
CONS:  Made from scratch.  So the wait time is fairly substantial (20-25 minutes in my case). Doesn't look like much from the outside.  Very small, only three tables and no restroom. Definitely intended to be a take-out only kind of place.
Three of us had soup noodles.  You pick your sauce/topping, then one of five kinds of noodles to go with it.  All three soups were super, with not too salty, flavorful broths and lots of meat.  I only wish there were more vegetables in my soup, but I guess it's a Chinese thing.  
A group of us went there last evening for dinner.  We had the private room which was very ornately decorated, One person at our table ordered won ton but was told to order this it would be for 12 and they could not make it for just 1 serving.  I ordered chichen chow mein thinking they could never screw that dish up.  it was not chichen chow mein and instead was pieces of chicked with spaghetti and and a light brown thick gravy.  Food was not hot.  Plenty of food for the money but not served the usual way in silver covered containers but on open platters which is also a cause of food getting cold. There was a lack of communication between us and our waitress.  Brought wrong dinners to wrong people and the same with the drinks.
-1 for the price, 100 for two, you'd expect great things...
We decided to give this place a try after moving into the area.  We had a place a little bit farther out that we have been going to for years so we were skeptical.  This has become our new place for Chinese takeout.  Great food, AMAZING portions, and decent prices.  Service is always fast.  We've tried several things on the menu and haven't been disappointed yet. I'd recommend them.
I would recommend,but for a casual dinner.  This is not one for a romantic setting if that is what you want.
Things we have ordered and liked: I really like the egg foo young. It doesn't make sense because the gravy is not that great but they load up the eggy patties with lots of stuff and it tastes great on rice. We get the combination. We also get the honey walnut shrimp. Sweet but we like it better than Panda's. We've had quite a few other things here and someone said everything they have had has been over 4 stars. I have to agree with that. It's been consistently good unhealthy fast food chinese when you're lazy and eatin' on the couch with your honey.
And then there's a special mention for the Beef on a Stick. Take the most flavorless cuts of beef imagineable, add a nice waxy texture to it, heat it, slam a stick through it and stick it in the styrofoam box. BLEECH. My wife ended up putting it in the dog bowl and our dog even refused to touch it. I'm not writing that to make a cute review, I'm simply stating facts. 
So i have been there a half a dozen times, and this time the food was just OK. Times before it was fantastic. They are definitely not the most polite people in the world, but the food is 'usually.'
I'll have to keep my eyes open around my area for a place similar.  Yum!
Do I have a serious craving for Chinese that wont go away if I eat anything else?  Do I live within 5 minutes of Jade Palace?  Do I like dining with people who average 85 years old?
The entree:  Absolutly disgusting.  I ordered the peeking duck.  They cut it fresh at the table and it looked great.  However they served it in rolls with enough BBQ sauce to drown a cowboy.  they killed the duck with all the sauce.  It was dripping out everywhere.  
You can also see how they make the noodle through the window inside the restaurant.
P.S. I believe the woman who took my order also delivered my food...a nice touch!
Well done (American) Chinese and not too heavy on the corn syrup/sweetness like some places. This is probably a 3 1/2 star place that gets the extra half-star based on limited good restaurants in the north phoenix area. Their mapo dofu is quite good, and so is the walnut shrimp, along with their house fried rice. Polite delivery drivers and prompt service. Never eaten at the restaurant but have been impressed that even when delivered the shrimp doesn't get overcooked/stringy during the delivery, but still arrives plenty hot.
BBQ Pork with Rice. 
I've been searching for a decent take out Chinese place for awhile, and there are a few in this area. This hap pend to be the first one I tried, and maybe ordering the traditional take out dishes was the downfall, but I was disappointed. 
The menu here states that the spicy chicken would be in a bean sauce but we received it in approximately eighty percent sriracha sauce and the rest was mostly oil. This was the better dish.
4 Stars for food & 1 star for SERVICE (lack of thereof)  Can't believe that they refused my order 30 minutes before they close.  I WILL REMEMBER!!
Great family owned place. Cheap lunch and the food is great. Good service. What more can you ask for.
I really enjoy eating here for a price friendly yet still tasty and appetizing quick fix for Chinese food. The food is well seasoned. Surprisingly haven't had anything too salty. And their service here is spot on. They are attentive and super friendly. And this place isn't really a "Chinatown sit down restaurant" it's a delivery lunch special plaza Chinese joint but they serve you as if you're eating in Chinatown. If anything their service here is better than your typical Chinese dining restaurants. Everything is well priced and the beef chow fun is particularly my favorite. Keep up the good work Rice n Noodle. Hands down my favorite quicky Chinese joint
A pipe in a soffit broke and water was pouring down from the light fixtures. Instead of not taking anymore orders they continued to, While everyone wwho was seated and waiting for food had to wait longer, Manager was very uncooperative, I kept saying could we get our money back.... She kept saying one minute!! while helping new guests that arrived!!!!! We waited about 1/2 an hour until another employee (most were taking photos and videos) finally decided to bring us ourt food bagged!!!! Bad circumstance, very bad recovery!!!!!!!
We were sweating by the time we were done eating, so my craving for spicy this evening was hit right on the spot!  Gotta love it when a craving is satisfied!
I felt like Marco Polo discovering what a noodle was for the very first time....
We were looking for Chinese for lunch on a Saturday & was very pleased.  The food was great & service was excellent.  Prices were average. Will visit again!
From there we moved on to the peanut noodles which were probably the best thing we had, but it required some work on our part. There is a chinese peanut noodle dish topped with a sweet soy sauce that I tried to replicate with normal soy sauce. It elevated it to edible which is more than I can say for the other dishes.
Come eat here people!  You won't regret it!
Authentic!
SO DELICIOUS! I can't wait to go tomorrow for their lunch special!  It's like $5/dish and my favoriteeeees are black pepper shredded beef and xo green beans .. oh my they are SO yummmy .. i'm getting hungry just thinking about it!  I think this is the best place for authentic chinese dishes in Vegas!
Our servers, yes servers, made us feel very comfortable and we ordered drinks that were not on the drinks menu.  I had a Strawberry Daiquiri & my girlfriend ordered a margarita.  We also ordered appetizers; "Seared Ahi Tuna" & "Szechuan Chicken Wings".  The drinks came quickly as well as our appetizer.  My girlfriend ordered the "Peking Crispy Duck", half order and I ordered the "Chicken Teriyaki" with an extra side of steamed rice.  The appetizers came out first, and they were excellent.  Then our order came out and it was nice & hot and very fresh.  The food tasted very, very good and was cooked to perfection.  We savored every bite.
Interesting note: the urinals are AMAZING!!! No splash back. NONE!!! (Only men can truly appreciate that fact).
The wife n I just checked into the Hotel n were craving Asian food.  We were dressed super casual despite everyone else dressed up for a club or funeral. No worries, the hosts and wait staff were excellent.  Although the prices for one of their "Top Chef" portioned dishes might set you back an hour's worth of wages ($22-$50), the taste was superb. We ordered short ribs, garlic shrimp, and vegetable fried rice. When our food was brought to our table I initially thought I could eat the entire thing as an appetizer..however, after splitting the entrees, my stomach was satisfied.  Just be advised that this place cost some bucks...but if you got a couple bills to invest in some fine dining, I suggest u give it a try.
Staff is unfriendly here.  I pulled into the parking lot and was getting out of the car.  It was 850pm and the sign said open.  One of the staff members pushing a garbage can said we are closed, "no mo" I asked aren't you open until 9?  He said yes, but the last people are in the drive thru now and that's all.  Your sign says open, but you say closed?  I guess you're more concerned with going home for the evening then my business.  Poor representation of your company.  Plenty of substitutes.  I'll stay with Pei Wei.  For a buck or two more, the service is superior and no comparison between the two.
Our entrees were so good, reminding me of the old fashioned Chinese restaurants I went to with my parents in late 60's-early 70's.  (Anyone remember Toy's Shangri La??)     
I was seriouly disappointed in the tangerine beef I ordered as the main meal.  Most of the pieces were far too large to eat without cutting, they were over fried and leathery and they tasted of seafood, so someone didn't do a good job of changing the oil in the fryer.  All in all a diappointing choice.  Unless you're close and don't want to travel, I'd find another place to sate your Chinese cravings.
I got strawberry boba and it was very good but I think I'll try mango next time. They also offer taro. They're more like a slushee than a smoothie, though. 
I dropped by again today to grab some lunch specials and work my way through their lunch special menus.  The Curry Chicken was excellent, and the way the chef cooks the chicken was done in a way that truly shows that he has some serious culinary background. The chicken was still soft and succulent, plus the portion was generous. Good flavor, fine techniques, generous portions, and attractive prices =  I will be a frequent repeat customer as long as I live in Las Vegas.
So I was happily surprised when driving in Green Valley one day looking for somewhere to eat - I spotted China Tango.
We always like to experience different things so we order a variety of food. 
VERY bland. Everything tasted the same. Nothing was 'bad' but I won't be back. We ordered two kids meals, orange chicken, sesame shrimp and some pot stickers (dumplings). It was about $50 with the tip for delivery. If the food had some flavor ... no problem. HOWEVER
Horrible horrible place! 
Wow... Yum Yum....
Just your typical great panda taste! Best part was the quick service here.
Ambiance: 4/5
We have visited AJK several times now and are very impressed.  Fresh produce / food, good menu selection, reasonable pricing, nice atmosphere, friendly staff.  My wife has tried several items and has really enjoyed them all, I really like the General Tso pork (yes pork, I had only seen chicken before).
Nice decorations and inerior, that's about it. The waitress is not helping at all for selecting good menu. They are charging for hot tea and pepper oil.(I guess they need to do that recover from investing for the interior.) Go ahead cross the street and go to the food court in the mall. They have better service and half lower price for the better food.
I enjoy this place everytime I go in there. Its family owned and has consistently good food. Large soda selection with  awesome crab rangoon. My favorite dish is the Happy family which has beef, pork, chicken, crab, and veggies in brown sauce.
I believe this is a good intermediary for those of us who'll go out and try and eat with people who aren't lovers of exotic food.
It's not that good, the Lemon Chicken was tough and over cooked. Lemon sauce while it was on the side in the to go order didn't taste like lemon sauce. The shrimp fried rice was pretty plain and the shrimp was low quality and not very much. Good service and reasonable price, but not that good. Might try some noodles and maybe some veggie/tofu items if I ever go back. I wish it was better.
We got our order to go, otherwise I would have sent the soup and my dish back. And maybe would have had a different experience...
BBQ Pork - Always a favorite of mine.  This was juicy and tangy just how I like it.
Golden Gate is very disappointing.  I wonder how it could muster a 4-star average on yelp.  I went there with my neighbor on a whim and a prayer.  The place was clean and the service was good.  The table top had a stack of about 4 sheets of commercial paper for easy clean up.  The seats were covered in a plastic sheathe.   The food was thoroughly unremarkable.  We started with the crab puffs and teriyaki chicken skewers.  The crab puffs appeared to have a decent amount of crab, but the wanton casing appeared old and stale.  It wasn't served with any type of dipping sauce.  The teriyaki chicken skewer appeared to be deep-fried chicken tenders with absolutely no teriyaki sauce or flavor besides a soy sauce marinade.  They were left unfinished.  The entrees looked like 100% frozen meats and sauces.  They were absolutely artificial and flavorless.  Simply heated to a warm temperature and served on "Golden Gate" etched faux-china.  The place really needs to catch up about 30 years.
e.   Beef Tomato over Rice - Also a simple favorite of our's and I haven't found this on very many menus in the valley.  A simple home style dish and it was tasty.
Best $7 lunch in vegas. Fast hot and tasty. Cant go wrong.  Its just inside the gold coast.
Great food!  Service is great as well!
Interior: Pretty shabby...
We started with a large bowl of Hot and Sour soup, which was enough to feed four people. I found the taste above-average and very enjoyable.
Large menu. Well priced. We had three dishes.  We started with Curry Fish Balls Skewers $4.95.  There were 8 in all approximately the diameter of a quarter dollar coin.  The dipping sauce was sweet and creamy.  We both really liked them, but my wife blamed them for a stomach on the ride home.  Second we ate a dish of Chinese Broccoli with Oyster Sauce $5.50.  I love the stuff.  Great sauce.  Really healthy choice.  Finally, we shared one entree, which was some sort of chicken with flat, fried noodles and bean spouts.  All three were good. Bill totaled approximately $20. We will be back.
Best little secret!
Diverse selection of push-cart dimsum but unfortunately the lack of flow meant that some of the dimsum sat on the carts too long.  On the day we were at Peter Wong, some of the flavors were not quite right.  The tasty pan-fried chive dumplings stood out and is probably the only thing we'd order again.
Food was awesome!!! I had mongolian beef with out the regular onions. Not your regular mongolian but wow what a new twist to the flavor with the beef being flame cooked, it tasted like in stead of on flatgrill, that was my take to it due to the flavor. Tender meat is all i can say awesome awesome awesome. Found new Chinese delivery place! Throw out the rest of the wanna be ones. Great food guys i recommend it in a heart beat good quality good portions and taste to die for...might think this funny but the sauce from the mongolian beef made the rice taste better hahahaha. People over phone and delivery person where friendly as can be.... so i say YES 5 STARS must eat to see what i mean. Happy eating.
6) BBQ pork - had a bite, doesn't taste like BBQ pork but I'm not really sure what Chinese BBQ pork is supposed to taste like.... it was more like spiced Chinese brown sauce over pork. Either way it was tasty!
The salt and pepper calamari.. may not seem all that exciting or exotic, but it is delicious! I love the favors the green onions and jalapeño with the salt and pepper. 
Spicy Eggplant is EXACTLY how one would hope and dream this dish should be -- the eggplant is creamy / cooked to perfection and the yummy sauce displays green onion and garlic equally to the palate.  And it's always served really good and hot.
The only pro was that it was open late.
PUBLIC ALERT!!! Please read...
Ahh, the ubiquitous PF Chang's...
I have lived in Las Vegas 15 years, and out of the many chinese restaurants in town,  this is absolutely the best.  There are many variety of dishes to choose from, the food is always fresh. On sundays it is very busy, but  the  staff  will  go the extra mile to find you a table, the most you will wait is 30 minutes in comparison to over an hour  elsewhere. The staff is consistent and always get to know the local  customers as well as  the tourists who arrive by bus. It is located in a locals area, but has attracted tourists as well. This place deserves 5 plus stars, excellent food and excellent service. I love it here and you will too.
Food was ok, not awesome.  Fast Chinese food. Yeah, they cook it in a wok in an open kitchen but it's no where near the 'best' Chinese food I've ever had. No wait staff, order at the counter and they bring the food out (NOT necessarily all together and defnitely NOT appetizers first then entree - bizarre).  My entree appeared, we waited, then my wifes entree, waited, then my soup, waited some more then finally the spring rolls - I don't get it, deliver the whole damn order at once!  Clean place, it was busy.  Fried rice was disappointing - make better fried rice at home (it was basically brown rice with a few random peas and carrots thrown in).  Soup was good.  Spring rolls were, well, like a spring roll should be - nothing special.  Twin pork was a bit disappointing, pork had a lot of fat on it.  Would I go back?  Maybe if I was in the area and wanted take out, but that's about it.
Ok first of all I'm moved from San Francisco to Scottsdale, I always thought that San Francisco has the best Chinese food ever, but last night I looked up for Chinese delivery places and I found this, at first I don't want to order Chinese because I'm in Arizona but I did it anyways so it turns out this Chinese food is so good and cheap.
My parents and I ate here twice during our 3 night stay at LV. The food was fantastic. We were intent on not over-ordering but they kept giving us bonuses! We got a nice soup to start and also had a nice steamed fish for getting more than $30 in food. The dessert at the end was also delicious: a sweet soup with little jellies.
Oh...and to add insult to injury, service was so bad (food was slapped down on the table so hard noodles fell off the plate! I only got ONE glass of water as did my friend; they looked at me like I had NO RIGHT using chopsticks when I asked for them, etc) I didn't leave a tip...and the server chased after me as I was getting into my car, demanding tip money. I said no and drove off. I hope he doesn't realize I literally live around the corner from this place...
Overall, this is classic Chinese restaurant food and I would get it again.  But I won't be rushing back.
It's all very tasty and believe me, I wouldn't drive over 50 miles round trip several times a week just so I could yelp about it later.  I've brought many friends and family here and will continue to do so in the future because it's just that damn good.
We have been here twice last week and ordered at 11pm (10pm-2am) a 20% discount applies & 7pm. salt & pepper pork chops, black bean seafood chow fun, XO sauce green beans, honey walnut shrimp, seafood hong kong fried noodle, sizzling eggplant. All were excellent.  The staff was very friendly both visits. This is one of my favorite chinese food restaurant in vegas.
Good prices.  
with an easy location along university 
What a great little spot for reasonably priced Chinese food and lunch specials. The food arrived quickly and the lunch menu is very extensive. Along with your lunch portion of any given item, you receive either eggdrop or hot and sour soup as well as a spring roll. Portions are extremely generous.
If you don't, then you best start believing in it if you're headed to Flo's.
One Panda is the same as any other, whether it's in the mall or dropped next to a Walgreen's in suburbia. So I can always count on my free will being infringed upon and decision-making skills limited regardless of a particular location. 
OH nay, fancy chinese food=not cool.
Service...Hey guy, can I get a little help?...I can't choke down your crap without a drink refill. And "yes, I WAS done with that crap, but next time ASK to make sure.
Because I am not as familiar with some of the dishes, I asked a lot of questions of both the servers and the people surrounding us. I mean how else are you supposed to find out whats good if you don't ask and the right people to ask are the Chinese (I hope that doesn't come off as offensive because I do not mean it that way at all!).
I mean its Chinese takeout so honestly my expectations are always really low......but i am now just mad at myself that i spent 20$ on almost inedible food ....i ordered delivery and got the calamari (which does not travel well i know, but i had a taste for it) so it was a little mushy but more annoying it didn't have any flavor at all i would go as far as to say it was frozen......and the Mongolian beef was NOT spicy like it says , and it was kinda of slimy texture ....i dunno man maybe it was just my experience but if your in this area and want Chinese takeout i know for a fact theres better places than this one.....i believe in second chances so ill try again because it has 4 stars  but i  gotta say i dont think there will be much change : /
I went back and had what they are best known for which is their Pho. In particular, I order the beef and ginger pho. 
This restaurant is near my work on the westside.  I stopped in for lunch and was pleased with the prices, portions, and selection on the menu.  I had the Chicken Lo Mein combo which had good flavor and the noodles were cooked well.  Wasn't a huge fan of their fried rice or egg rolls though as both were a tad dry.  I'll try them out again though as I'm always looking for lunch options.
Chicken and Mushroom
I have to agree with the other reviewers. If you are looking for an authentic Hong Kong style noodle house, this is the best in the East Valley. Prices are very good, restaurant is very clean, portions are huge, and food is extremely tasty. Clear windows to watch the "magic" of noodle making, and the kids had a blast watching. They were even given a dough ball by the very nice chef to try their hand at it. Overall, quite impressed!  I would suggest the "Hand-pulled" noodles over the other variety.
My parents are from Hunan province, so we were looking forward to checking out this place. Their verdict: quite authentic. The cook is also from Hunan, and he came out to chat with my parents for a bit. He's very nice, as are the waitresses. 
I order 1 thing, and one thing only: General Tao's Chicken. Extra extra extra extra spicy, extra chicken (only $1 more). It is to die for. Great big chunks of chicken, tossed in a deliciously sweet sauce that is littered with chili peppers. Top notch quality. (under $10 and change with tax)
Ok, so maybe dim sum is the way to go on this place. The nice thing is that they have it all the time, and this place is open late (though they closed at 11 when I was there, despite teh giant OPEN TILL 3 AM sign). So maybe call first.
Service was pleasant (this time) but you only drink water unless you order a beer.
From the a la carte menu, we had the General Tsao's Chicken, which was served with broccoli.  This dish was pretty good.  The chicken was juicy and tasty while the sauce was both sweet and with some good heat.
Yea I know, Food Express Chinese Restaurant, sounds like a place in a Southpark episode. When I arrived, the place was packed with Asians spinning their lazy susans around, which is always a good sign of a good hole in the wall chinese restaurant. The interior had strip mall written all over it from the Casino carpet (probably from Station's Casino) to the cheesy neon fish light fixture, i don't even know what to call it.  
If I'm ever in the area again i will definitely go back here!
-Green Onion Pancake $7.99 (I requested for it to be extra crispy which was delightful.)
I wanted to eat American Chinese food for lunch and I thought I might as well give this place a try. I have to say I like my usual place way better than this place.
Good news, bad news here.  Unfortunately, the good news is that it's really good food and pretty reasonably priced.
Next, egg noodles with the eggplant and garlic sauce. The eggplant had such fantastic depth and flavor. The noodles fresh, cooked appropriately and providing fantastic flavor. 
My order was ready quickly and the staff was nice.  Another good spot nearby is Wang's Delight which is diagonal across the Ray/McClintock intersection.
-Steamed dumplings - Typical steamed dumplings.
Singapore noodles are sort of a hard dish-it's either oily and flavorless flourescent yellow with shoe-leather pork or an incredible marriage of char siu and curry.  Hop Kee was certainly leaning toward the latter.  I really liked this dish, so much so I wore some home without shame!!
Maybe someone new was trying to cook that day .
I arrived to pick up the food a few minutes before it was ready - and was surprised to see spring rolls in the order which I hadn't asked for. I guess that's their way of saying "sorry you had to wait" -- Great service. 
Thank goodness my friend gets comps because this place was overpriced. Okay, but let me also say that the food here is good. I ordered the duck noodle soup with egg noodles which had very generous portions of duck. The noodles were good too. I would have to complain about the $8.00 ice cream dessert list. It is such a tiny scoop, more like a sampling from a tiny spoon. If you have the money to spend, then this place is fine, but you'll be paying triple for what you can get at a regular Chinese restaurant.
I did all my yelp research before going into Vegas for Lunar New Year/Superbowl weekend and for someone that is not a huge fan of chinese food....I loved this place.  Service was great...complimentary soup...who doesn't like free! 
- My water never came. I could have asked, but I wanted to see how attentive the service was. (-8 points)
As you can see, I'm writing a lot of reviews these days because this is my last month on Yelp. Before I split, I wanna give credit to some of the unsung and under-appreciated small businesses in the NW area. DRAGON WOK is one of the better Chinese places that I have eaten at in Las Vegas. And I believe it's even better than most places on Spring Mountain. Summerlin/NW does not have many traditional style Asian restaurants. But places like DRAGON WOK are the closest you will ever get. 
Been meaning to try this restuarant out for a while now.  Finally went there for lunch last week.  Was a little nervous as we arrived about 12:50pm and there was only one other table that was occupied.  An empty restuarant is not a good sign.  But we stayed to try the food anyway and I am so glad that we did.  I have to say the food wasn't bad for $4.50 a dish.  We had the wonton noodles, pork and century egg congee and chicken chow mein.  The wontons were very tasty, the chow mein dish was pretty good, but the congee was not as flavorful as it could be.  By the time we finished our meal, the restuarant was nearly full.  I guess the lunch crowd starts at 1pm here.  Will definitely come back to try some other dishes.  They have a huge selection dishes and I was surprised to see that they also serve some Hawaiian dishes.   
Literally, Dragon Garden has all the ambiance of a Dunkin' Doughnuts. Sterile white, pop-in lettered menu boards, humming soft drink case. Cafeteria-y. Staffed by my mother's body double who wasn't doing any cool stunts. Bummer.
The price to food ratio is outstanding. I've order a few times and the sometimes throw on a free side dish.
I came to Diamond China with some friends on a late night after watching a movie (see below yelp review too for my movie theatre review :) It's one of the Chinese restaurants that is open late in Vegas outside of the Strip. They are open till 2:00am Friday-Saturday and Sunday-Thursday 11:00-12:00am.
I haven't eaten Chinese food in years. (Other than Pei Wei... and I don't really consider that Chinese food... More like Asian fast food or something)...
It's OK. I came here because my coworker was sick and all she wanted to eat while we were in Vegas was noodle soup. Such a waste of a Vegas trip when I wanted to go try the new Caesar's buffet. But whatever. 
A few members of our group speak Cantonese and talked to the chef for quite some time, before, during, and after the meal. They did indeed fly 2 chefs in for this restaurant and it seems to have paid off. The 2 do every single bit of preparation themselves with no help, and have friendly rivalry going in the kitchen. It makes for an amazing back and forth through the entire meal, with each dish better than the next. By the end of the meal we were even invited to take a peek in the tiny kitchen.
The walls also had Chinese menu in characters which I think is a sign that this is is a legit place. I like it and will be back.
The Cultural Center is a huge beautiful building. Something that Phoenix really needs. But, it looks as if there is quite a few empty business spots here.
The location is strange, you definitely need to know where you're going to find it.  It's easy to miss the turn, and it's such a narrow driveway that a car cannot get in if another is trying to get out.  Just be on the lookout!  Once inside, the ambiance was strange.  The tables and decor felt classy, but the bright fluorescent lighting contrasted for a more industrial feel.  
On the plus side, everything came out immediately and was piping hot.  Unfortunately it all came out at exactly the same time so we felt pushed to eat quickly so it didn't get too cold.  We also discovered that the "small" dishes are actually hardly small at all and we really ordered WAY too much food.
First off they can't count but in a good way!  They gave us 2 extras but from the looks of the other reviews maybe it's a good strategy to boost word of mouth.  It's working right here!
Pleasantly surprised at this little gem.  I had the curry tofu and my partner had the orange tofu... we finally stepped outside our box. (I usually will order something like the moo goo gai pan at restaurants like this)
The prices are fair and their luncheon specials are very reasonable @ $4.95 which comes with an egg roll and fried rice. 
The food has been fantastic, the staff friendly, and the atmosphere nice. I love stopping in even to get a taro boba tea, or to have a sit down meal with my husband. I have yet to be disappointed.
beef dish- flavorful and tender
I'll be back!
Good to have another choice in Queen Creek for Chinese because there are not that many good ones out here.  Go try it, I really don't think you will be disappointed!
I was happy to see that the Crab Rangoons came with spicy mustard, which is one of my favorites and it was super good!
Never heard of this place before, but we stopped by today.  We ordered the seafood combination, Mongolian beef, and lo mein.  Everything was delicious and the portions were so plentiful that we could not finish the food.  We will definitely swing by again if we are in the area.
 It's making me want to vomit just thinking about how to describe the food. 
Hot & Sour soup -- It's not easy to find a good one (Sesame Inn's is excellent) but, still, if you can't do something right ... this soup was too corn starchy and just plain lacked flavor.  Not enough vinegar, among other things.
They have a full bar so for those special meetings, plenty of drinks are available.
This place is around the corner from our house, so we decided to try some takeout tonight.  It's not the best Chinese I've had, but it satisfied the craving I had for chicken and broccoli and meant we didn't have to cook. For 2 people it was less than $20 and we have leftovers for lunch tomorrow, so that's super cheap in my opinion. Will definitely order from here again...and probably get it delivered so I can be uber-lazy!
Cheap styrofoam and plastic ware.
My wife is Chinese and very fussy she gives it 4 stars too it must be good.
anyway...my husband just picked out some food and brought it home.
What can I say? It was a $5.40 (after tax) meal that was worth... $5.40. It wasn't great, I've had much better Chinese food, but it was decent enough.
-Seafood and sizzling rice (rice cakes) - This was one of the stars of the night. 
So far, I've had the Chicken Satay Skewers, the Pork Egg Rolls, the Broccoli Beef, the Tangerine Beef, the Cashew Chicken, the Orange Chicken, and the Pork Fried Rice,  Everything has been great, though the Tangerine Beef is really chewy.
Not sure why I would ever come back here.  Would rather go to Panda across the street for some 2000 calorie items than go here.  
Prices are cheap (between $7-8 bucks for heaping servings of fried rice) and fast (5-10 minutes tops). Did I say I love fried rice?
and just the most vile thing in the world- the sauce was just
Next up came an order of pork dumplings which are served either steamed or fried (steamed in our case), these were simply beautiful and quite tasty as well alongside a small dish of traditional soy based dipping sauce. (our resident vegetarian enjoyed her 5 spice tofu lettuce wraps while the Hipster and I demolished the dumplings).
-Eggs w/ Tomato
Huge portions, very laid back atmosphere. The best fried rice & tofu and veggies in garlic sauce we have tasted in the valley! Owners are great - he is the chef and she takes care of the front.
Bar none, THE best Chinese in the Valley.
The food's not bad. The service lacks though. The last time I went there, I ordered lobster only to not get it until I mentioned I shouldn't be charged for it at the end. And then the guy complained about not being tipped enough but why am I tipping for the lobster portion of the meal if I never got the chance to eat it?
I am shocked by these reviews.  Has anyone ever tasted their tasteless egg drop soup?  Has anyone ever tasted their mushy fried rice (of late) ?  Has anyone ever tasted their tasteless beef?  
This is a family run place and the daughter can normally be found up front, and the son makes the deliveries. They are super nice!
First off: There was only one waitress doing everything in the front of the house: taking orders. answering phones, cleaning off tables, refilling drinks and taking orders to the tables. And the service was horrendous. I waited at least five minutes before she took my drink order, and another ten minutes for her to take my food order. If you wanted a refill, you literally had to flag her down and tell her.
Go.  Go now. Go often.
It's a choice for Chinese food considering the plethora of Vietnamese offerings at the Mekong place across the street.  Service was slow on this full Friday night and did see a couple walk out, but the staff is super uber duper friendly (owner waitress to the young guy waiter).
So I arrived and the hostess lady said all the tables are full and that I had to wait 10-20 minutes.  She then gave me one of those vibrating alarm things that would go off when a table becomes available and she was like, "Make sure you stay within 10 ft, so we can reach you."  Not sure what the whole point of the alarm is if you can't walk father than 10 feet from the restaurant....
I have been eating Authentic Chinese food for over 45 years including New York Chicago and San Francisco so I do bring some background to my rating.
Coca Cola Chicken and Veggies
I'm a big Chop Suey fan but its not a lunch special  so I ordered off the regular menu, I can't say I was impressed, although the veggies were crunchy there wasn't much flavor to the sauce.
I enjoyed my meal here, so I'd recommend it if you're in the area and craving Chinese food.
Worst Chinese Dining ever, and on my Birthday too, customer service is rude & my appetizer was the last dish to get into the table... 1st and Last time here
Just wanted to have some decent chinese food this weekend nothing too authentic because it's not available in town. So Pf Chang's right? Wrong. Steam rice was dry,
Typical mall restaurant that you can find almost everywhere! The smell of the food and the price will draw you in and help curve those hangovers then spending lotsa money at the buffet. 
We loved the Crab Puffs, Sesame Chicken and Broccoli and Beef.  We liked it so much we went on Friday and Saturday.  Service on Friday was great, Saturday it was packed and the service was a little off (thus 4 not 5 stars).
The food is great with hand made pulled noodles and dim sum. The chef was actually hired from China for the restaurant so it's as authentic as you can get by Vegas standards. 
I love the potstickers here! Yet to try more of their menu. Cleanliness I would say is not too good so if that really bugs you I would not suggest. Miso soup was yummy too. Cheap lunch specials.
I've had good meals and service here in the past on annual trips to Vegas, but not this time. Drinks sat empty waiting for refills, the server walked away without mixing the sauce for lettuce wraps and didn't return til we'd given up and attempted to mix our own. The salad was inedible, the meal wasn't much better. Undercooked rice, no flavor. No sign of our server for at least 15 minutes while we waited for our check. It was lunchtime on a weekday, not very busy. We went here as part of a long standing family tradition, but won't waste another Vegas meal "time slot" on this place. Try Kung Fu at the other end of town.
I'm continually amazed that people think that China, with its 8 regionl cuisines and varied biomes and some dozen odd ethnic minorities , will always have the same stir fried beef with broccoli and done the way they had it in New York or whatever American Chinese eatery they had growing up.  Please people, this restaurant serves east northern ( dong bei) homestyle wheat based dishes.  They may have some of the American Chinese dishes on the menu but that is  for the clueless diner that wandered  in wantingpork fried rice and egg fo young for  chinese dishes and not what they specialize in.  Please read Jennifer 8's great book on Chinese reataurants and you can undestand what the differences are.  
A coworker said to me, "hey lets get some Chinese". Why not, I had no idea it was going to be this good. I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken, it was spicy and awesome, great flavors. This is probably the best thing I have eaten all month, best $6.50 I ever spent.
Worth a trip here!
Things ordered:
Hand-pulled noodles, whoa. When you try the noodles, you'll be disappointed going to other chinese restaurants. This place is not americanized, and stays true to their culture.
Did someone say Lobster fried rice?!?
-The water they serve already came pre "seasoned" with lemon :)
I got the spicy orange chicken lunch combo which came with an egg roll, crab puff, and fried rice, all for just $4.50!  I'm not a huge fan of lots of breading on my meat so I was thrilled that there is a pretty minimal amount of breading on this dish.  My husband ordered the kung pao chicken which came with the same sides.  This was also very tasty and we were both amazed at how fresh and crisp the vegetables were, almost like they add them near the end of the cooking process.
I read some of the negative reviews about this place, but I tried it anyways. I called in a takeout order, and was told it would be ready in 30 minutes, it did take a little longer, but the food is the best in town, and the portions are generous!
I chose Roasted Duck and BBQ Pork Soup.  It was beautiful.  Glistening, fatty duck and lean slices of BBQ pork floating among baby bok choy over thin egg noodles.  Clean, clear, deep-colored broth...not the oily kind commonly found in your average Chinese restaurant.
I'm not a fan of AZ Chinese food but it sure beats a 400 mile drive to California.
My meal was okay but nothing to give it 4 or 5 stars.  With that said, it's an okay place to go if you are in a hurry and are too lazy to make your own rice.
But,
Yummy Yummy is located in the shopping plaza on the south east corner of Thomas and Sdale road... There are so many eating options here as so many new food chains are opening up...
China Star Buffet is located in North Las Vegas off Craig Rd.  I've been here about 3 times in the last 2 years and each time was because one of my team members wanted to eat here.  I take my team out for lunch just as a reward every once in awhile.  I give them the choice where to eat and they usually pick something cheap.  I'm not complaining, that just means less expenses for me.  I still think they select something cheap so that I don't expect more from them, lol.  Anyways, China Star Buffet seems to be their favorite. 
So my son did the ordering.  He ordered a double order of crispy fried gau gees, stuffed duck, harm har ong choi with pork, kau yuk, beef broccoli cake noodle, spicy fried pork chops, fish cake with vegetables, and oyster sauce chicken.  He actually wanted to order a few more things, but we told him that we had more than enough food already for three adults and two kids.  
Dan Dan Noodle, simple and right on, small bowl, but rather cheap.
Last but not least, the Thai Basil Chicken with no basil.  I'm betting the cook did not read the order, or chickie who took the order wrote down chicken with broccoli, because while there was no basil, the broccoli was in large quantity and cooked to perfection.  The chicken...no.  It must have been cut and then steamed and left in a tray in the preparation area.  The pieces were very uniform, very soft (beyond tender) and flavorless.  While I could not see what the cook was doing in preparation, my bet is that he took already prepared broccoli, carrots and onion and tossed 'em with the chicken pieces, then slathered the whole thing in sauce.  
Beef cubes in blackpepper sauce -decent, good flavor, steak was not overcooked (better at Pho Kim though), 
Love this place!!!! I go there all the time and Lisa, the manager is amazing. She knows me already and we both have a good time a chat every time I go in. Lol but we both like to pick on my boyfriend when he comes with me too. ;D love this place. Love the food. Love the people.
I have long been in search for a chinese delivery place that can do a good mu-shu. I typically order from New China Gate, great food but mu-shu is not an option. When I got a menu for this place in my mail box I thought "let's give it go." Bad idea. The mu-shu was bland and had a bad texture. We also ordered the crab rangoon, they were awful, very thin and the little bit of filling they did have was overcooked and rubbery. The sweet and sour sauce even had a weird flavor. I'll stick with New Chine gate, but if your are reading this please make a mu-shu,
I liked, however, that the inside was actually nicer looking than I'd expected from judging the exterior. Service was also satisfactory.
Seriously this place is good. I've tried 5 dishes and all are good. Everything is made right in front of you in the wok. It's cleaner and doesn't leave you feeling like crap after. Good find. Mom and pop ran. Way better then panda could ever be and way better tasting
Food was alright not bad at all, portion is normal, and service is quick.  They came back to refill our drinks without asking.
Once we received our dishes, the beef looked not pleasant in the eyes at all. It looked almost like a mongolian beef with an old leftover gravy put on top of it. When I tried it. All you can taste is coconut milk, you can barely taste any other flavor. It was just horrible. As an indonesian and a human, I feel embarrassed if this is the kind of Indonesian food they serve to human beings. I know this is a chinese restaurant, but If you can't serve indonesian food, then don't put it on the menu! Maybe it was just a wrong day i went, maybe the chef was just not a regular chef that usually knows how to cook Indonesian dishes. 
I have been going to fairview over 15 years! Since waaay back when little Caesars was next door!! This place has remained consistant in  quality and when i need REAL FRIED RICE, BBQ PORK, EGG FOO YOUNG!.......OOOOOO!!!FOODGASM!!!!!!!!!!   WHEWWW.......... or awesome lunch specials I know I can count on them! The place is older and can use a makeover but none of that matters to me as long as my food is worth my money and my gas!
Three visits and only one sub-par experience. Went for lunch once and dinner two times. Our first lunch experience was interesting. Food was great, portions big, wonderful value for all that you get. The only thing I didn't like the first go round was that plates were left on empty tables for what I consider an extreme amount of time 15-25 minutes, and service wasn't excellent. Luckily all our subsequent visits have been great and the service has not been an issue. I order Four Seasons and I love it. Nothing in the dish is over-cooked which is hard to believe as it has shrimp, pork, chicken, and beef. Hubby orders fried food such as orange/ lemon chicken/ pork which is good as well.
2) It tastes reliably great every time I go.
They deliver for a $2.00 surcharge, up to 4 miles away.
I love this place! Great delivery range and pretty affordable, and for how good the food is; forget about it! This is the first place I recommend when it comes to Chinese food.
hot and sour soup was yummy, and the crab puffs too.
With Beijing Noodle No.9, I have to say "5 star price, 1 star service"
$14 for a glass of wine and $20 for walnut shrimp covered in sugar sauce.  I hope this place gets new managent soon.  I know it is Vegas, but really, please prepare the dish as it is described on the menu.
Service was good, friendly, efficient and we didn't experience any language barrier that other reviewers have mentioned.
The food is awesome! It tastes great! This place only comes in second (in my personal experience) to a Chinese restaurant in Anchorage Alaska. We had Sesame Chicken, Lo Mein, a beef dish, and an order crab wontons (which were free with a coupon given with the menu). The portions are huge! We ate our fill and still had enough for two people to have full servings for lunch the next day. I can't recommend this enough!
   Correct preparation, inspirational sauces - not this time.
We got the wild mushroom and lamb with chilies, both where really good, my favorite was the lamb. But a little greasy by the time you got the the bottom of the plate. 
Original:
the Szechwan Beef Noodle Soup is my favorite. the broth is flavorful and kinda tangy.. and the fried rice here is good too. the beef rice noodles are a good choice too if your not really in the mood to drink soup.
-Phil A
Well I like the new Bejing Beef with lo mein noodles. It is pretty tasty, quick and convenient. The egg rolls I didn't really care for. But the pepper chicken is good. 
Looked promising at first. There were 4 people ahead of me in line when I got there. Menus are printed in color on nice paper, they don't have it displayed on the walls. Decided to go with the Orange Chicken lunch special since the price wasn't too bad, $5.95. I also ordered the Vegetable Egg Rolls. I was going to try one of their smoothies, but they didn't look very good in those machines. Like they weren't mixed very well. I paid for my order and they told me it would be a 10 minute wait. No problem, since they were cooking everything fresh (I think).
Still a very strong 4!
Excellent food and service. You can check out their menu in the picture's section on this page and visit and Like their new facebook page! 
The spread was pretty impressive with good dim sum, breakfast, and pastry as well as a noodle station, meat station, and a huge dessert room.  Overall, when comparing this place to the Bellagio brunch, the Jasmine spread looks much better than it tastes.  Nothing was that memorable except for a few things: Wu Xu-Style braised short ribs, crystal prawn and spinach dumplings , chicken-apple sausage, and lastly the Peking-style duck in steam buns which is served one per customer.  If you really like chocolate, the dessert room alone might be a reason to go.  You can choose from ice cream, sherbet, chocolate fondue (including dark chocolate), chocolate-covered strawberries, and various cookies.  If you want just good buffet food, go to the Bellagio buffet because the taste is better and its cheaper.  But if you want elegant dining and beautiful food presentation (and you are a chocoholic) on a Sunday morning, the Jasmine is worth the experience.  The downsides are the prices, the fact that drinks are not included, and the overall unimpressive taste with some exceptions.
Being from Brooklyn I have a PHD in Chiney Food. Roast duck and Pig hanging in the window. Hand stretched noodles. Albeit we are a far stretch from Hop Kee or Big Wong in Chinatown this place does not dissapoint. They have the usual suspects here, even enough to satisfy the PF Changs crowd. Why people spend there greeny's at changs just blows me away! 
About an hour later we are walking around Target and my stomach starts to burn. I feel this intense burning sensation in my stomach for the next two days. I think there is some kind of issue with MSG here possibly. I don't know what else could have made me feel like that. I also didn't eat pretty much anything for the next two days because of how bad my stomach felt. 
Mapo Tofu is my fav dish here.
In all seriousness, I agree with Kitty, it was greasy and bland. The BBQ spare ribs were probably the worst I've ever had, the sauce was tasteless and watery and there was very little meat on the bone.
I am obsessed with their spicy shrimp udon soup for just $4.95. It is a perfect starter or side to a meat and rice entree! Or if I am craving all noodles (which I do very frequently), I can order one of their fantastic noodle soups. Great pricing and perfect portions!! It is always nice to see lower prices on appetizers and tapas so that you can enjoy a good amount of variety on your table.  
The chicken didn't taste like meat, and the spicy eggplant wasn't spicy. The fried rice was okay, but didn't taste like much either. 
*Cake Noodles: basically clumps of crispy noodles and gravy with fairly tender chicken perched atop. Not mind blowing, but you can't really go wrong w/ crispy house-made noodles.
Lunch special was $7~10. It took few minutes for them to take our drink order even though there weren't that many people. 
Spicy cucumbers... accompaniment of some fresh veggies.
The egg rolls were overcooked and the filling was not tasty.
There really isn't an atmosphere. - it's a buffet, after all The lighting is bright and the tables are close together.  There are people who remove plates as you go up to get another plateful, and fill your soda glass. I am stuffed when I leave here and my nephews are too, until they get home and watch TV and start in on popcorn.
*  Lunch Buffet only $5.55!
i ordered the egg foo young, with barbecue pork. it was decent to average, nothing special. i was kinda surprised to not see gills or fins on my egg foo young patties...as they were swimming in a 1 inch deep puddle of a gravy. while the gravy tasted good, i kinda like the option to drown my own food. not have it delivered to me already floating.
My friend ordered the noodle soup with chicken nuggets, so I just had a taste of hers. Broth was amazing with complex flavors, noodles were somewhat soggy, chicken nuggets were really dark chunks of soy sauce chicken (looked like beef). I wouldn't get the chicken again, but maybe try the beef noodle soup next time. 
ehh it wasn't the best but not the worst.
Totally dissatisfied with the food except for the Jelly Fish and Chicken Salad with Sesame dressing, one star for that.  The rest were below par especially their sweet and sour pork. 
Honest opinion stay away and find something else
Mu-shu chicken was actually very good, despite looking bland. Kung Pow chicken remained relatively untouched after the first taste, had some very unusual flavors that shouldn't have been there.
anywho, I decided to give this establishment a shot. I wasnt feeling well and wanted something hot and spicy to go (well without waiting too long and I was burnt out on the 'merican fast food). 
I would've given our experience 3.5-4 stars but when you charge for something you CLEARLY state are comped, then take a couple off and STILL include a couple, that's just crappy. $15 bucks off of $75 wouldn't have broken the bank and we tipped $20 on top of it. So, beware of their FB promo.
Anyway, they gave me wonton chips while I waited. They were stale, but who cares?  I didn't come here for that.  Literally within ten minutes, I had both of my food items and they were pipping hot! The crab rangoon pops in your mouth and their sweet & sour sauce is pretty good.  The honey walnut shrimp is a large helping of medium- large sized shrimp that don't taste like they were previously frozen and they are pretty thick.  The sauce, although still not my favorite, isn't too sweet and has somewhat of a tang.  I would order both again and will definitely recommend them to friends.
Sadly, I went to pick up my yummy food last Friday night and there was a sign inside saying they were CLOSING 12/20 due to the fact they had lost their lease!!! After drying my tears, I asked what happened and the server told me the landlord didn't renew the lease and instead is leasing to a 'burger joint' WHAT??? 
The portions are very generous and rarely does a person leave without some to take home.
Had the ox tail soup which was very good. The steamed rice was undercooked, service was horrible.  Also had some dim sum which was all very good! Lucky for us the meal was on the house!
Wor won ton soup, All i can say is wow. Besides this place i don't know what other place serves the Wor won ton soup. i was used to it in Cali. 
It's hard to find good Chinese food in Arizona where Asians are 1% of the population. It takes me an hour to drive here, but I am SOO coming back for the food! 
Sorry China China..better luck next time..
Mediocre chinese food; it wasn't bad, but it wasn't unique.  The host and my waitress were nice, but we waited long for our food; about 30-45 minutes for 4 dishes for 3 people.
We kindly asked manager to check it out. Long story short, they turn into deny mode. And finally removed the extra marked item we never ordered without offering any apology and sorry. Mistake does happen, but don't pretend that you don't know it. Admit it. The portion of the dishes are also shrinking. With the price and services, I can find better dim sum place. Yes. I am really picky on the food quality and service. 
I was hoping this place wouldn't be good, but much to my dismay the orange chicken was surprisingly tasty (the portions are minuscule, though).  That's too bad, because this place is all the way across town for me, and now I feel compelled to return.  Ugh.
I hate to be so critical of Mr. Hunan--a mostly takeout joint--because the people behind the counter were very friendly, but the food was so oily and bland that it's hard to describe. I mean, it's hard to make "Hot and Sour Soup" neither hot nor sour, but my try of this famous soup at Mr. Hunan revealed that it was indeed possible.  My main dish fared no better. In fact, it was so bland I've forgotten exactly what it was that I ordered! 
Perhaps to punish me for my insolence, C Dubs sends an obnoxious and easily confused driver in a bad "I'm going to community college to learn how to be a game show host" suit in lieu of our modest and very smiley normal delivery guy. 
All that being said. I love Wah Kee. Their noodle dishes just hit the spot and are among the 3 things I crave when sick (the other 2 being yukejang and pho). They actually make their own noodles here so really, it's the thing to order when you're here. Ohhh I should also mention that I don't typically like Americanized Chinese food b/c it's so greasy and heavy. But arg. Their noodle soup with a dollop of hot sauce. omg. I want some right now.
The best part? They deliver almost all over Edinburgh so you have no excuse not to try them!
Pretty pricey for Asian noodles but since it's in Vegas, I guess it is a little more expensive. I had the Szechuan beef noodle soup which was super delicious for $15 including tax. The beef was so tender and soft, soup was super flavorful, spicy but not too spicy, and filling. Will definitely come by when I'm back in town too! Oh, and it is authentic Chinese food : PLUS!
Try the egg flower soup, eggrolls, peanut butter chicken, CRAWFISH, broccoli beef, siu mai, won tons, baked mussels and scallops.
Wife loves the schezuan beef soup and fried rice. Good Chinese food that's somewhat authentic. Price is somewhat steep $35 for noodle soup and fried rice.
I had the minced pork dish and a taste of a seafood and beef stir-fry.  Overall great tasting flavors! Most Chinese joints is about the sauce, here it's the opposite, it's the noodles! When you take your first five bites, you almost forget about the other ingredients! It's that yummy!
This would have been a one star review if my first experience was as bad.
General Tso' Chicken - always cooked to perfection however this time it was heavily garlic tasting I am Italian so I can handle garlic, but to some people that might be considered way tooo much. The first time I got it, it was amazing like this time it was crispy etc.. however just sightly overly garlic 
I really wanted to like this place. I craved Chinese food tonight (and let's face it, I'm a sucker for crappy Chinese food), I was hoping this place would hit the spot.
The food was incredible.  My buddy ordered a 1/2 duck, 1/2 chicken, pepper pork chops, beef chow fun and Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce.  
We have ordered here a few times its pretty good its a small "mom and pop shop" but that is what you want with chinese food!  The spicy fried rice is pretty good I was expecting a bit more spice, but hey it was still different and yummy
Ordered the salt and pepper pork chop because of another yelp review and also they list it as Chef's special.  These turned out to be double breaded and deep fried pieces of pork with a ton of bone still on.  Some pieces was just deep fried bone. And the extra, extra, extra breading they coat it with is completely bland and tasteless.  I think they should call it the NO SALT OR PEPPER pork chop.
Little Szechuan is the closet neighborhood Chinese restaurant, however I've been too scared to eat here.  Why?  From the outside, it looks like a porn shop.  (Can I say that here?)  It is a freestanding nondescript white brick building with all the windows blacked out, and no menu posted at the door.   I like to look thru the windows before entering a place, so I at least know what I'm getting myself into.
I've been going here for years. Convenient location for me. I've tried a few other Chinese take out places in the vicinity and none of them were as good. I feel like they're not as good as they use to be. The shrimp dishes aren't that great. But I always get General Chicken and Beef Pepper Steak...and they're both good. Prices are good and staff is nice.
Very good Asian food.  The ingredients are very fresh and flavorful.  I loved the Shrimp in Lobster Sauce (hard to find anymore) and the Moo Shoo Pork as well as the Hot and Sour Soup.  I try to go there once a week.  Love the Shrimp Fried Rice as well.
The meats, which we had the displeasure to sample, were tough, precooked but not seasoned and the worst crime was they were not the customary cuts customers of hot pot, shabu, have come to expect.  Lamb was more like Mutton leg meat, most likely conveniently same as used in the skewers, cut lengthwise along the fiber, and merely dropped into the luke warm soup giving it no taste and impossible to chew.
Simple, this place is much cleaner on the inside and out than your typical chinese fast food, even though the price is the same as those place. The food is well executed by a good chef, not drown in soy sauce like most other places. Most important of all is I didn't get stomached after my meal here. 
This place made me feel at-home and comfortable (I'm always eating in Boston's Chinatown) and had a RANDOM gigantic wait/line on a Monday night, so you know they're good. The mini hot pot is delicious and feeds two just fine, maybe even three. Our wonton appetizer tasted like heaven - probably the best wonton I've had in a very long time. This place was probably the best and most accurately priced food I had during my entire Las Vegas stay. Thanks, Noodle Exchange. Extra star for cute waiter.
Overall, they are a better choice than some of the options in the area and if you are in need of a party spot, they have a reasonably sized private room for such an occassion.
1 star for crappy food and crappy service!  They are surviving because of the location and I hope someone shuts these fools down. They even have waiters that can't speak english.  Authentic chinese waiters but crappy chinese food!
We got pork fried rice, shrimp rangoon, seafood hot & sour soup, and sesame chicken. The portions were huge. I think we'll have enough left over for lunch and dinner again tomorrow. The fried rice was very savory and would be wonderful on a cold snowy day when you want something to warm you from the inside out.
For those who aren't from the East Coast, let me learn you something.  NY Chinese food is considered Street Food.  It is supposed to be cheap and quick.  The taste isn't supposed to taste like it took hours to prepare, or even something that health nuts expect out of beef and chicken.  It's supposed to be dirty with a hint of flavor, thats how Street Food is.  Cheap and Quick.  
The food is good, not great. The portions are alittle too pricey and small for my liking.
 This chinese restaurant is probably the only chinese restaurant in Vegas that has the closest dining experience to the chinese restaurants that I enjoy in San Francisco.
My noodle dish just really didn't have a whole lot of flavor and was not even remotely spicy for being titled 'spicy noodles.'  
Wow, wow, and more wow.  What an amazing place and maybe a new favorite for me and my wife. Simply amazing.
if I could give this place a NEGATIVE star I would! I ordered the Shanghai Beef, was told it would be 1.00 more, they "padded" it with a HUGE pile of kung pau chicken. This was for my 3 year old, I saw the beef on top, gave him his food...then I heard SCREAMING!!!!!!!!! He bit into a pepper....REAL nice Panda REAL nice
beef medallions
They shouldn't be so stingy with the ice, our cups literally had like 3 cubes per cup, and when they refilled our water, there was no ice in it at all. When we sat down, when they poured our water, the waiter guy overfilled our cups resulting in water spilled on the floor and splashing onto my feet. It's just water, but still annoying. 
Great tasting food at cheap price.  Love their Orange Chicken and House Fried Rice.  Found their menu online  www.greatchinalv.com
This is a little hole in the wall take out joint. You could eat in, if you want, but there is little ambiance and only 4 tables. 
After not visting this place for as while, my family and I vistited Ming's (a long time favorite of ours) only to find it under new management. I have to say as good as Ming's was previously this new cook and staff has only made it better. We had Kung Pao Beef, Seseme Chicken and Fried Rice...each were absolutely delicious, surpassing the same meals at this establishment previously. The staff was friendly and attentive (not that that was ever an issue here). I did notice their taven was closed. If you've been before and liked it, I suggest go again and LOVE it.
The food was amazing.  I ordered the spicy Szechuan chicken with steamed rice and an egg roll.  My wife ordered the sesame chicken with steamed rice and an egg roll.  We both drank water so it only cost us $10.88 -- seriously.  For lunch.  In Phoenix.  VERY good value.
Pot Stickers - Perfect crisp on the dumpling and delicious pork/scallion stuffing.  Best Potsticker I've had in Las Vegas.
Flo made her presence known which I also found refreshing. Everyone was friendly & the food was top notch; you go girl!
The service isn't too personable. They won't small talk with you while you wait for your food but they aren't rude by all means. 
The food was good but definitely not worth the price, although we got the meal for free, or authentic. The goldfish tanks in the front attract the many people who walk by but the walls inside seriously hurt your eyes... Bright and abstract. Service was good and food came out at a decent pace.
We came here for lunch on a Friday at 2 pm. This is the least busy I have seen this place.
Service: GOOD!!!!
Kobe Beef Tartar - excellent, 5 stars - the tartar was very tasty and smooth
The top it all off, we were not offered any other drinks, server just gave us water that tasted so bad due to the fact probably because the glass cups were not washed well as you could see other lip stains. We all felt grossed out and sick after and my 3 year old daughter was nauseated  all the way home.  Me and my wife had a headache as well. Probably because, i presumed of the MSG and uncooked seafood and the overcooked egg fu yung.  
You can probably do better in Las Vegas, you can probably even do it better for less.  But it's convenient, and that's why you're going to go, but you knew that too.
Great place to grab a good breakfast boritto when stuck on a layover. The rice they add to the standard bacon and eggs makes for a mild asian flavor. This stand is owned by pfchangs. The food quality isn't the same but its a notch above the standard fare. Give it a try.
VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED that they don't have mini hot pot anymore!!!
Great sushi at decent prices! We stayed last week at the Excalibur and wanted a nice sushi dinner. We were lucky enough to get a 20$ dining credit with our hotel reservation and wanted to use it here. We went on a weekday and got seated right away. Great ambiance! Very sexy and romantic. I tried the Rice and Co. Dragon Martini which was WONDERFUL! Made with fresh strawberries MMMmmMM. We ordered the calamari which was DELISH. So perfectly cooked and great dipping sauces. We ordered 2 rolls which now I can't remember their names!! But one had eel and cream cheese and another had spicy tuna and spicy yellowtail. Both were very fresh and delicious. We really enjoyed it and seriously spent as much money on the food as we would have at home. For sure a place to check out if you are not on a "living large"  Vegas budget but want excellent sushi!
My wife called me and ask if I know any Chinese's restaurant on her way home from work. I looked in Yelp and found Chop Chop Wok. When she came home she had lots of good food to eat. She told me she order the family meal which was about $25.00. It came with soup, three main courses, rice and egg rolls. The food was really good the next time we are in the mood for Chinese's food we will head to Chop Chop Wok
All in all, China Joe's doesn't stack up to my favorite (Joyful House), but since Spring Mountain is 15+ miles away...China Joe's will have to do! LOL
I came here with my in-laws who were visiting from India and were so freakin' tired of pasta, raw vegetables, and cheese.  Oh, America.  I tried to tempt them with Japanese food at Mizumi but raw fish wasn't up their alley, either.  We stumbled across Red 8 and their eyes lit up.  Pan-Asian, it was!
The egg rolls while not greasy seemed a little cold but nothing a microwave can't fix right?  They even threw in a large glass of ice for my 2 liter of coke lol. Yes I have always had a pretty good experince with them except when it comes to the wait time for the food to be delivered. I kid you not it took almost a full hour just to recive my order. But I will chalk this up to the driver most likely getting lost. Try this place out when you don't feel like cooking and want something besides pizza.
fast and friendly service. came in on a saturday night around 6p and the place wasnt terribly busy...
This place has the best Chinese food, PERIOD.  I love the unassuming title, building exterior, location, etc.  But don't let all that fool you.  Food Express knows Chinese food, and they make it fantastic.  Their prices are more than reasonable for quality Chinese food with generous portion sizes.  
Needless to say, it was a good meal, definitely good Chinese food, and will return. 
If you are craving dinner and are on a budget you can still eat here.  Not one plate on the menu is over $8.00!  I think I ordered enough to feed a family 2 nights in a row, plus lunch for work and for about $30. 
Picked up a take-out menu as i was leaving and noticed they had "Almond Duck" and "Sweet & Sour Duck" on the dinner menu.  I've been looking for "Almond Duck" -- square-shaped pressed duck covered in sweet/sour sauce and topped with almonds -- for the last 20 YEARS or so!  I'm going back to try both of these dishes on their menu! 
Edamame, mustard greens and pork - I've had this dish at other places and this was pretty standard, but good. I thought it was decently prepared. 
With so many different real deal Chinese dishes to chose from, why even both with sweet and sour pork?
When the bowl came, we were dismayed to see there were only 2 pieces of pork in the entire dish, both about the size of a domino.  The noodles were literally about 2 feet long and almost impossible to get out of the bowl and eat.  I will say that the dish was tasty, but spending almost $30 to get a bowl of ridiculously hard to eat noodles and 2 pieces of meat was infuriating.  I will not be returning.

I went for dinner at the sushi bar on Wednesday night around 9pm.  The restaurant was reasonably busy, with the wait for a real table being 15 minutes.  I started with the Crab Mango Cucumber salad, which lists ingredients of fresh king crab, English cucumber, mango, and tobiko caviar (fish eggs).  I substituted the citrus lime vinaigrette for a mayo-based dressing that comes by default.  Those items are actually all that come with the salad - no lettuce less two leaves of romaine for decoration.  In fact, it was pretty much a bowl of crab meat and dressing.  Although this wasn't my expectation, it tasted okay (emphasis on "okay").  I was nervous eating the ample quantities of fresh seafood for a $9 price point at the Luxor, but I woke up not sick today so I think I'm safe...
Well, It is kind of hard to find decent Chinese food on the Strip or even China Town. Somehow, in my opinion, Red 8 had pulled it off. On my most recent visit to Red 8, they had made some improvement to the quality of the food and a noticeable change can be compared to my earlier visits. For example, They no longer cook Xiao Long Bao in small foil. I also tried their pepper and salted seabass and it was heavenly. The crispy pork also taste really good and so was the duck. I recommend any patron who visited this restaurant to order to BBQ combination plate for its varieties of meat. I would definitely come back here again!!!
Went in a large group and we didn't know what to get, so the server suggested a tasting menu (I have no idea how much this cost).
Delivery: 1/5. Food was 20 minutes late and ICE cold. We live at Dobson/Baseline, not even five minutes from the restaurant. This was unacceptable. 
(Entree) Tofu Veggies - Good. Came with good portioned white rice. 
Quick, easy, yummy takeout. Try the veggie lo mein...
I had dinner at the Lotus last night for the first time in a few months. 
The price was very reasonable. I will eat her many more times.
I started looking at the menu and was looking for the eggrolls and edamame and all of the dishes I a used to but to my surprise none of those were on there. There was pork belly however. I did not try it when it came around but everyone who ate it really liked it. The menu was very helpful because it was marked by spiciness. I do not like spice so I made sure to stay away from the *. The food looked amazing when it came out and I tried everything I could. 
It should be called Noodle China. 95% of the dishes are some variety of Chinese food, be it Shanghainese, Taiwanese, Cantonese. 
Written via Blackberry
MMMM the cashew chicken and MaPoTOFU soooooooo good :)
5.  Since I did take out here, I did not have an opportunity to check out the bathroom here.  This is always important in an authentic chinese restaurant as the best of them in LV have the worst toilets............ More to come on that when I go back.  But, isn't it odd how the best have the worst?
The food here is pretty good. I got a mushroom soup and it was huge!!  It must have been the family size because the bowl was bigger than my head. The broth was so good though! I tried my friend's dish and it was really good, too. I would definitely come back. I need to try more food here to see if I should maybe give them 4-stars.
beef tongue is not as spicy, but definitely a bit chewy. 
ATMOSPHERE: I like the color scheme in this restaurant and have never been disappointed with the table we've been given. One thing I would admit: the other diners in my group did not find the chairs very comfortable.
We go here religiously whenever we are craving Chinese take-out (which happens a lot!) I could imagine this place is overlooked but it seriously has some of the best food in town. Service is fast and the food comes out consistently great every time. Order the pork fried rice, you won't regret it.
i ordered the orange chicken lunch combo with white rice instead of their fried ( was just in the mood for white rice) and got it in a jiffy  (means less than 10 minutes)
The Sweet and Sour pork - again, overcooked, burned breading on the outside.
 
If you really want authentic Chinese, this is the place to go.  KJ is the only place we go for our "family dinner" since they've opened.  
The second you walk in, Gary greets you by name, with a handshake and a hug. From the deco to tablecloths to the full bar, the atmosphere is always inviting. Best part about this place is the 'home kitchen' where everything is made fresh to order with great tasting ingredients. Best Chinese food in Scottsdale and the only Chinese food in my stomach! Thanks Gary!!!!
I've been looking for a good place to get Chinese food besides Chinatown so i stopped by this place since it was close to my house. The menu had a lot of the usual items you would see at a Chinese place. I decided to go with the lunch special since i just wanted a quick bite to eat. The place was empty and all of the workers were sitting down eating lunch. 
Overall impression:  It's a little better than ok.
The Food:  The first course was traditional chinease egg rolls.  They were very yummy, they succedded in elevating something plain to something extradinorary.
Big mistake. 
I can't eat at a place that is 86 degrees. I know that electricity costs go way up in Summer but I will never go here again. Even though the food was OK.
Owners of Drift and Stingray, I give you props once again for opening up another fabulous place in Old Town.
Setting: Very nice and Asianish as in they have a lot of statues of budas and what not. Very Asian detailing on the walls and plates and the colors were RED (obvious from the name) and black. 
However.  The server couldn't understand ANY English.  I had to point at what I wanted.  I had to point at a pot of tea to show I wanted hot tea.  I asked for another serving of soup, he brought a bowl.  Beyond the language barrier, our server forgot half of our order!  I had to remind him after chasing him down for another menu to point at this.  I eat at a lot of foreign restaurants that I can get past the language barrier but it was poor, overwhelmed service coupled with a lack of comprehension.  
Being from California where there are a ton of very good Chinese restuarants,  I've become pretty picky about my Chinese food.  Most places have a horrible brown sauce and lots of heavily breaded deep fried items,  that always make me feel sick after eating.  But this little hole in the wall has some of the tastiest food in the Valley.  Fresh and well prepared, excelling in both spicy (Szechuan Chicken Wings - loaded with Jalepeno's and garlic) and mild (Seafood with Tofu Hot Pot).   And probably the best won tons (Hong Kong Style Won Ton Soup) as well.
We will definitely be back. I'm even planning on dragging my hubby in and making him try it. I know he'll love it once he gives the place a shot!
* Sliced Ribeye Noodle Soup (rice noodles) - So good! The noodles were soft (we could tell it wasn't made in-house though), beef was delicious, you can add bean sprouts and lime. The broth was a tiny tiny bit light on flavor, but my mom (the expert, of course) said it was perfect.
If you like spicy food, this Sichuan spot has your name written all over it!  Known as one of the Four Great Traditions of Chinese cuisine, Sichuan food can be described as spicy, hot, fresh and fragrant. 
The open kitchen makes the restaurant unlike many other Chinese places. It's very clean and you can see all the actions clearly. The staff are professional and very efficient. The ambiance is cozy and modern. Apparently they have done some good design work to cater to a younger crowd. The menu is also designed in a way very easy for non-Chinese people to understand. Very good job with that. 
In one word, my carry out lunch experience at Hsin was WEIRD. When I walked in, I was pleasantly surprised by the clean, modern ambiance. It's definitely an upgrade from your traditional Chinese place. But, it was SO hot inside. I felt badly for the two other people who were dining in. With all of the west and south-facing floor to ceiling windows, they really need to pump that AC to combat against the power of the AZ sun. 
So i decided to give this place a try based on the wonderful reviews on this page. However, i was very disappointed to find that their chinese chef left for chicago so they are no longer serving their specialized authentic chinese cuisine. 
Appearance was very nice, dimly lit clean with some characteristics of a traditional chinese restaurant Id find out here in the city. 
very fast!  Standard Americanized Chinese food offerings.  It's pretty much the best place in my neighborhood, where nobody really appreciates good Chinese food.  We had the Tangerine chicken, Tangerine Beef, Vegetable Chow Mein and some Egg Rolls.
Overall pretty good! I would give the place 3.5 stars but rounding it off to 4.
For food alone, I was considering a 2, but with the ultra cheap price, the free delivery, and the little bag of bribery containing the wonton strip thingies, I'll bump them up to a 3.
The chicken smelled a little different, but when i tasted it I could tell that it had been left out on the counter for hours instead of being in a cooler prior to preparation. The pork lo mein was OK, so I ate some of it and the dumplings were edible.
I usually get the Sizzling Rice Shrimp, but the server mis-heard me one day and brought the soup instead, and now I crave it day and night.  An order of that and a Tsing Tao makes the best lunch *ever.*
- not much seating
Old place, great food!  You won't find anything fancy here, but the food is just plain tasty! It's classic Chinese food, red lanterns, red booths and everything, tucked away in the corner of a half-dead strip plaza, which means plenty of parking!
When you first walk in it smells like frying rotten eggs or sewer gas. 
Flamingo Special Chicken: Delicious, chicken was crunchy and juicy. 
Prices are very reasonable. In the $$ range. They have only 1 location in Madison and they deliver to Middleton and they accept pickups.
But this is not why we love dining here.
Overall the service was superior, attentive but not intrusive. The meal came quickly. And the bill came without having to chase down a waiter. 
The waitstaff are friendly and pretty attentive, you do have to request the Chinese Hot mustard and chopsticks, our waiter was smiling and knew we weren't from the states, he stated only people not from the states order those items.
g. Do you consider Fortune Cookies to be Chinese or Asian?
I've been dying to try this place ever since I heard about it. Mr. Dumpling is located in the same shopping center as Pho Kim Long. 
This is such a tough call. The food is really, really good. The actual restaurant itself is below par. That said, here ya go ---
Went to Cafe Noodle over the weekend and I was disappointed with some of my dishes.  I was craving roast duck and char siu and found both to be less than stellar.  The pieces I got were too fatty and were lacking in flavor.  One highlight was the wat dan har fan (shrimp and scrambled eggs on rice).  This great comfort food dish had a light sauce and large, plump shrimp.
This was not that place.
The lunch specials are huge plates and you can choose white rice or Brown. No substitutions on anything ,which is the norm.
I had some bad shrimp...very sick for about 24 hours. I knew it the second I bit into it that is was bad. Luckily I did not swallow much of it. The people there are very sweet, but just keep an eye out on the seafood.
Ordered the kung pao pork and a couple dim sum dumplings. Freaking loved the kung pao, some of the best I've had in a long time. To be fair, we were eating lunch at 4pm, so I was crazed with hunger. But I feel that even if we had been eating lunch at a normal time the meal still would have been great. The service was really fast, the food was tasty and plentiful - can't really ask for more. 
The Orange Chicken is all white meat which makes it a little more dry than normal, but I still like it more than most other places because I prefer white meat anyway. My brother likes the General Tso's Chicken more though because he says it's less saucy than the Orange Chicken. The Kung Pao Chicken I tried today had way too many veggies. I know it's suppose to have a lot of veggies, but there was hardly any meat at all in there; I might as well have just gotten a vegetarian dish. 
*Pork Wonton in Red Chili Oil -very juicy and just the right amount of heat
The man on the phone sounded like he didn't even care, he didn't even try to help us.
For our main dish i got the Spicy Lamb Dry Hotpot, and oh em gee was it spicy, it was delicious, if you do order it, order so gai lan (chinese broccoli) or something to go with it, you will need it. 
Wasn't the best food but decent food. 
I especially like the store located at Buffalo and Lake Mead and the store at Durango just north of Centenial.
Love the Teriyaki Bowl w/ chicken.  My husband always orders their Hot & Sour Soup and Garlic Chicken.  Egg rolls are more like spring rolls and I don't really care much for them.  Their Egg Foo Yung is decent enough, but can be a bit greasy.  Prices are average I suppose for carry-out Chinese.  Not great, but definitely good.  Be sure to add your coupon if ordering online because they WILL NOT offer it to you over the phone.  :)
All the food we received was lukewarm at best, cold at worst. It's chinese food. It can hold at nuclear temperatures, and I don't think it snobbish of me to assume that delivery people can afford to invest in a proper traveling method. I must admit, my major problem with this is the fact that it took nearly an hour for the delivery person to get here. Which means assuming that the food left fresh, it spend a half-hour uninsulated. I don't believe I'll get sick from this food, but considering that being served very hot food is clearly the industry standard, it still seems sketch at best, and disgusting at worst.
I wasn't expecting a whole lot from the Hot and Sour soup, but it was fresh and filling. Mix in some of that rice and Sriracha and you're golden.
*Pork and Shrimp Potstickers, dough made from spinach: never thought I'd see green potstickers in a fairly typical-looking noodle house, but these were a tasty take on an old favorite. 
You get your moneys worth all of the portions are a really good size and their food is always great. We eat here a lot because its by our home and every time is a good experience.
gf was very happy that the chicken/veggies were properly prepared.  unfortunately, she tasted the honey shrimp and pork and that opened the flood gates !  The chicken and veggies were quickly placed in a to-go container and the girlfriend orders the citrus beef ( I think that's what it's called - cost less than $10) and it's over - she wolved most of that down ( btw - we agreed that was our fav dish of the night ) 
The Japanese name is a bit of a fooler, and kept me from visiting for a while.  It wasn't until I noted on the sign the Chinese characters for "Sichuan" that I realized what this place actually was.
In brief, we now enjoy dining in Lee's garden better than any other Chinese restaurants in Madison. It has officially become our second dining room and I believe it deserves my highest compliment! :)
2nd time I tried the "Spicy Hunan with Tofu", and it was probably the best  chinese with the perfect spice ratio.
A really strong 3, almost a 4.  I would definitely try it again if I was in the area.
I promise you will not be sorry.
- orange chicken
With that confession tossed out there, I ordered from Great Wok tonight. I came home after work, giddy with the thought of a three-day weekend ahead, and realized the only fish I had in the house was a very unappealing frozen piece of tilapia. The woes of Lent. I can't survive off of the wilted English cucumber chillin' in the veggie drawer, so I had to give in and order delivery (I have the horrible tendency of not leaving the house once I get inside and realize how comfortable the couch is. Unless something important is going on, like a hamster fashion show or Chumbawamba's reunion tour. You know. The big stuff), and it had to be either a) vegetables or b) seafood. Chinese clearly fit these categories beautifully.
This was my first time in this place..my aunt and I were skeptical at first as the parking lot was empty.  We walk in and no one is there except the owner.  We order moo goo gai pan, chicken with green beans and wor ton soup.  We really enjoyed the moo goo pan...very tasty.  Not too many drink specials and the ice tea was not too our standard we thought it was regular ice tea but he brought us green tea in a bottle.  I would try it for delivery as it's near my house.
My uncle, cousin, and I grabbed dinner here after I had spent an entire day wrangling the children (boy aged 3.5 and girl aged 1.5) with their parents (my cousins).  Oh, it was the best babysitting reward I could have asked for!
Didn't see much BBQ items though when I came in on a Monday around lunch time.
Food was ok, but delivery service is absolutely horrible. I ordered during the night, and the driver didn't get my address correctly, which caused a 10 min delay when the driver figured out they screwed up. Then, when the driver delivered my food, they had the audacity to tell me that I should have ordered sooner. This is all after they had a terrible attitude over the phone when I placed my order. Now I'm the type of person where when I go out to eat, I normally add 20% gratuity on my bill, even if the service wasn't spectacular. For this, I couldn't even add on a tip because the service was so bad. It was like they had no appreciation for the huge mess up they did, and then blame me that I should have ordered sooner. 
I really hope this is not what China tastes like...  There are corporate chains that have better food, and THEY are horrible...   You can tell the ingredients are of the lowest quality and cost the owner the absolute least amount....  Plain and simple, just another "don't care about quality" place in a busy strip mall....
     l
Long live China Gate! If there was a mecca of Chinese food for me in Arizona, it was China Gate which was torn down in the construction of Metro Center to make way for a Petsmart, Bed Bath and Beyond, Subway, Blockbuster, and Starbucks. No joke.
You KNOW a restaurant is great when you go somewhere else and think, "Gee, so-and-so's food is soo much better than this..." Dragon Wok IS that restaurant, the one you compare all others to... the one that tingles your tastes buds and leaves you wanting more.
Okay, so part of the one star rating is my own fault.  It was the first morning on my first trip to Vegas.  We were staying at NY NY and got off the elevators at 930am after a long night and saw "Chinese Buffet Brunch!"  Now, why on earth did I think Chinese buffet - for breakfast - would be a good idea?  I'll never know.  The place was packed though, so I followed the leader.
So many other better places in Vegas to dine.
Chicken was good,rice was good,egg rolls were good but it needed some MSG or something a little bland for my taste.
It's great in a pinch! The service is friendly, and while not the most attentive, they do genuinely want to help and care about your experience. Everything is made fresh, which is a huge plus.
The service was top-notch, which is half the battle.  For a sit-down restaurant inside a casino, my expectations were limited.  I was pleasantly surprised to have had a good experience.  The appetizers were tasty and nice size portions.  The main dishes were  presented well and were also flavorful.  One thing I noticed was that they did not try to substitute spice for flavor.  The dishes were tangy without killing the flavors of the food.
My absolute favorite dish is the Kung Pao Chicken! I also love the sizzling rice soup, outstanding!! You cant beat the prices on their lunch specials. 
Water, cornstarch, egg & ??? Even some MSG would have been nice.
The prices are extremely reasonable.  Everything on the menu, with the exception of ONE item, is less than 10 dollars.  I would recommend a Combo Entree.  With a Combo, you get your Meal, plus some wafers (they have a name, I just can't remember them at this time), two eggrolls, and 1 Crab Puff.  Very, very delicious.
Beef N Broccoli: Flavorless and gross. 
This place is really great. The menu is extensive so it takes some time to get through your first visit. The selection is wonderful. The prices are amazing for the amount of food you get. I love their potstickers! The only reason I gave them 4/5 stars is because their service can be really slow. They usually only have 2 girls working a completely packed dining room. All in all, a great place!
- Mushroom Noodles
We are fans of this little local place - but we are not fans of buffets (just our own personal preference). 
*Crispy Garlic Chicken
I've dined at this carry out Chinese location numerous times over the past 2 years.  My office is only a mile or so away and it makes for a quick meal.  I must say, I feel like something has changed in the past year.  When I used to go, I felt like no matter what I ordered, it all looked/tasted the same. (ie sauce, color, vegetables, etc)  But for the past year or so, my coworker and I marvel at how great the food looks when it comes from the kitchen.  We primarily dine in.  We're practically giving each other high-fives, because we feel like we just scored big.
Here's the thing --  there was a lot of food. A hell of a lot. It didn't come on one plate. It came on three, plus the soup. A full platter of broccoli beef, a vat of rice, and five or six crab puffs. It was hot, fresh, well-seasoned, and cheap. Those are the four food groups, right?
The WTF Name: 
This place is a oh ok nothing espectacular ! I will visit again when on this side of town love there wonton soup.
PS: I did note there was a Chinese-language-only larger Dim Sum menu available than the picture-book-for-starters however I can't read Chinese and only saw this after getting the bill so can't comment on the dishes without pictures (tm).
This place is has surprisingly good chinese food, but it's waaaaayyyyy overpriced.  But I eat here anyway since it's close to TAO and I'm usually way to drunk to stumble any further for food.
Shrimp puff was surprisingly good, though over-fried.  I wasn't expecting the filling to be curry, but it was pleasant.  If they could fry it less so it's not so painful to eat that would be my favorite appetizer.
Chicken Lo Mein - Husband said it was just ok
Dragon Palace is fantastic. The staff is friendly and the food is excellent.  The potstickers are to die for and the chili dipping sauce is amazing!
Lived in Dongbei for a few years so have had this type Chinese food before.  My first visit the flavors just brought back happy memories.  For the most part the staff is very friendly with occasional exceptions.  Everyone I have introduced to this place go back on their own later.  The best Hot and Sour soup in town.  The fried rice is nicely done not overly saturated with soy.  Pork pies are my favorite of the dumplings.  The fish filet in spicy oil is awesome, also available in beef or pork.  Don't let the name fool you is is not greasy, the majority of the broth is water not oil. and it is minimally spicy unless you ask them to kick it up.  Green onion pancakes are tasty.  I've tried a lot of things and the only one I wouldn't order again is the chicken skewers, too much cumin for my tastes with the chicken flavor but the same cumin on the lamb skewers was fine.
I don't know why all the other reviewers were so negative. This place was really good! We ordered 4 rolls, 1 bowl of combo rice and chicken chow mein, Everything tasted fresh and really good! Give the place a try!
I can't wait to come back! :)
The glass on the table wasn't clean & the lady said because of the water....hmm...I don't know, but I believe no matter what, the glass need to be clean (at least).
Worst food, waste of money. Better off buying Panda Express
I love China Chili. The food is definitely Americanized Chinese, but it's also delicious!
I like the open kitchen, where you can watch the chefs and cooks whip up your food as soon as you order it. Ordering take-out took just a few minutes and the staff was very attentive. 
The portions are very generous.  The food is actually pretty darn good and they deliver.
Chow mein: Wow looks can be deceiving! The noodles didn't look that great but the taste was definitely there. It had like a soy sauce and light teriyaki taste with some possible oil. 
This is a small husband/wife operated restaurant where the wife serves as manager and waitress while the husband and his 2 apprentices make the same hand drawn noodles as at the highly (expensive) regarded Beijing Noodle No. 9 in Caesars.  We started with an order of vegetable spring rolls that were light and flavorful. We also shared a bowl of Lan Zhou noodle soup which was delicious, but a bit too spicy for Ann.
Completely unimpressed. Went here on Friday for my birthday expecting good things. I was pretty disappointed at the end. I was with quite a few people and they all concurred. The sushi was boring and bland, very small rolls especially considering the price. Our server was sweet but not very fast and took forever to come back and take our food orders. Our food came out staggered with huge gaps in between (a big no no at restaurants, timing is everything). One of my friend's beers came out completely warm - WTF? The only good thing was that the drinks were strong and the staff was friendly. This place was a miss for me.
Jjampong-spicy is the only thing I taste. It looks great with the seafood and veggies, but that's about it.  
Rude service and over priced over cooked food. Everything was really greasy and had a reheated taste.
The Hunan Chicken was excellent, lots of chicken in a savory, hot brown sauce with broccoli, snow peas and red peppers.
   The chow mein noodles take up a small portion of the plate. I left a few Chinese restaurants slightly let down by too much of the plate filled with ordinary chow mein noodles. For the record, the chow mein noodles are tasty.
There were a lot of different entree items that I hadn't seen before & I decided to try the Firecracker Chicken Breast. I was warned up front that it was really spicy, which made me want it even more :D 
Look no further. Best Chinese food delivery in Tempe. House Chow Mein is my favorite. Not Greasy, lots of meat and veggies. Delivery is fast and friendly.  Orange chicken was right, but rice is average. They get 4 stars because I got a crispy roll with my meal but it was really hard, maybe overcooked. Regardless, I love this restaurant. Portions are generous.
Due to the long delivery time and the gamey taste of our chicken, not to mention nothing was still hot when it got here.. I would never eat here again. I do not recommend anyone eat here!
I had a great dinner on Friday night, but must give my review with a caveat.  The restaurant was offering a deal as a fundraiser for Japanese relief, so we ordered from the specialty menu, which was different from the regular menu.  
Choices for decent Chinese food in south Phoenix are so Slim!  I was so glad to find Li's Bowl with my handy dandy Yelp APP.  I've been there now four times and have not been disappointed with any of the meals there.  Until a recent discovery Li's Bowl was one of my "go-to" spots.  I am not saying that this place is Panda Express, Li's is much better BTW.  I will continue to come here when I do not have much time and in the area.  
Tea is provided, and between that and the water, you probably won't want to order a coke or anything. The tea takes some getting used to, but soon you won't be able to eat lo mein without it. And expect to get your water glass refilled like at least a dozen times. Literally, I've never actually finished a glass of water before it was refilled. 
Egg flower soup: I'm not a fan of this in general so I skipped it, but my wife enjoyed it.
Stir Fried Bok Choy: $12.00
I would rather stab my eye with a dull piece of fortune cookie than to revisit this greasy, smoky chinese restaurant in sin city.  It's a sin to charge $15.00 for pan fried noodles anywhere, especially if the server never returns to fill up your water.
I am SO HAPPY Tott's has come back so quickly!  Still the best Asian food in town.  Judging by the crowd most of Mr. Young's regulars are finding their way back.
The building it self is nothing of note just another new strip mall structure, and the inside although not in typical Chinese decor; is more of an office break room feel. 
Soup Dumplings.. dumplings filled with a meat ball and meaty broth.. oh yeah!!
Not a bad spot if you are getting lunch as they have good lunch special deals.
Absolutely amazing food. I love placing a to go order. Staff is always so friendly and I will continue to order from here!
Food is awesome! Smaller portions than most Chinese restaurants but still hits the spot! You may have a bit of a wait for your food. Definitely worth checking out.
But still, I kept going. I wanted Panda. It was not open for debate. I ordered my typical 3 entree plate with fried rice, 1 orange chicken, 1 kung pow chicken, 1 mandarin chicken. This is very important because I've calculated that it is the order with the highest meat per vegetable ratio. 
Orange juice 
Geographical proximity has always been a bane for my proclivity for good authentic exotic food. Needless to say that has never stopped me from trying all the close establishments. Chinese food being one of my favored cuisines led me to be easily convinced to accompany me colleagues to this joint. The first impression was quite decent. Also the fact that it was once a Vietnamese establishment that catered to wedding parties gave it a pseudo garish pomp. Ordered the egg[plant steamed fish, green beans... while friends ordered the kung pao, lemon chicken (oh lawrdy!! bleah...). Not bad not bad , I mused to my self and put it down as another place to revisit.
I would definitely go back again. The food was great and the front of house staff were very nice and friendly. The China Magic Noodle House is tucked away in the Lee Lee Market Center on the southside of the property. I was very pleased with my experience and even more excited they are down the street from my house.
Iv'e been to dinner at Flo's with a party as big as 17.  Finding a restaurant that will please the 17 distinct and neurotic personalities of food-mates, (Settle down, I keep you anonymous) is no small task. 
They are very good about keeping their offerings fresh and rotated, unlike the revolting "Yes Buffet" on Fish Hatch. Family owned and operated, meaning they recognize their regulars and treat them like family!!! They only have meat egg rolls in the buffet, so every time i come in they automatically bring out some veggie ones at no extra charge, since I am a regular and a proud vegetarian. GO JADE GO!!!!!
Want to go on a dumpling (aka potstickers) rampage. This place has you covered. Many different choices. Service was very good.
The quality of food is much greater than the price.  Best Chinese take out I've had in a while.
Price: 4.5/5  Reasonable, good portion.
The lunch specials are cheap. Like $5 or under cheap. The portions are also a reasonable size, so it's a good deal for $5.  The corn soup was...interesting to say the least. Not something that I enjoyed at all.  I had the cashew chicken as my meal (it's not on the lunch special menu)...large portion, tender chicken, and lots of cashews. I didn't care for the light sauce very much actually and was disappointed when there were no green peppers in the dish. Also, the carrots tasted a bit off to me.  My co-workers all enjoyed their dishes, which included sweet and sour chicken and peking duck.  The bill for the five of us (including tip) was $40. So an awesome deal, considering two people can't even eat at TGI Friday's for $40 anymore.
There's a choice of five types of noodles, but we homed in on the hand-pulled version. They also offer wide noodles, shaved noodles, thick noodles and vegetable noodles.
Either way I will definitely be ordering from this place again the next time I decide I want Chinese food delivery!
what's cool is that they offer brown rice and i don't recall them charging extra for requesting it (take note other nickel-and-dime you to death restaurants)!
Took way too long for delivery.  Food was decent.  Crab Ragoons were delicious.
I haven't been to any of the China a Go Go locations in a couple years, but we decided to go here last week for dinner. We ordered Family Dinner A - $25.95 which came with 2 Egg Rolls and 2 Crab Rangoons, soup (Egg Flower), rice (BBQ pork fried rice), and two entrees (Orange Chicken & Beef Broccoli). It was more than enough for two people. In fact, it was enough for our dinner that night AND lunch the next day. The food pretty much tasted like most of the other Chinese fast food joints. My favorites were probably the BBQ Pork fried rice and Egg Flower soup; both very satisfying. The staff were all very friendly and attentive. We dined in, so they kept refilling our glasses and making sure we were doing alright. This location definitely has much better service than a couple other China a Go Go locations I've been to.
I love their boiled wanton soup here. It has just the right bit of kick. I crave this like crazy and can't get enough. I love any of their shrimp dishes and often order shrimp chow-mein. I also highly recommend their orange chicken. It's among the best that I've ever tasted. It definitely beats Panda Express.
The ja jang mein (Korean black bean noodles) is delicious, too.
     e
I totally agree with Yelper Heinz comment. Vegas was in desperate need of a HK style cafe and I've been craving it ever since I've moved here from L.A and for all of those that lives in L.A. you have something to be very thankful for. It's HK cafe paradise in L.A compared to Vegas. Anna's Garden did meet those cravings. Food was tasty and the price was not bad at all, the staff was very attentive and friendly. The decor was okay not as fancy and modern as some of those you've been to in L.A. There was three of us and we order 6 dishes and all was good except the steamed fish wit black bean sauce. Just don't order fish at a chinese restaurant if you don't see a fresh fish tank there. It was a couple of fish fillet sitting on cubes of tofu with some chinese greens, the taste was there but not very satisfying. Other dishes we had were Jellyfish appetizer, fried chicken wings, seafood udon, beef chow fun, and honey with walnut shrimp... all tasty.  You also get a house soup of the day along with the meal. I might be a regular if another cafe don't open up soon! O... they also serve dim sum all day.... have yet to try that!
Recently ate here, takeout, and was very pleased with food.  The orange chicken was slightly spicy and still crunchy, the brown rice was very yummy and the crab puffs have actual crab in the cream cheese - unassuming building but spectacular food.
The service is fair, the young man was nice but not overly friendly. After I got my food I found him sitting at a side station watching a movie or something on his cell phone. 
Then, the real test, the check came. And to our pleasant surprise, the damage was really not bad at all.... I mean to tell you this place is beyond reasonable when it comes to the check, we were both taken back by the great prices.  This has to be the
Pros:
Our waiter arrived to the table quickly and had our drinks ready within 3 minutes of arriving.  The menu at Blossom is simple and pricey, with some entrées at $300+.  
Different style of Chinese Food...Best pot stickers ever...homemade noodles are so delicious. I had pork won ton soup and mongolian beef over noodles...tasty !!! Very clean and nice waitress...small and cute place...quiet and dim :) I found on Yelp !!! Thanks
We moved to the area in 2005, that's when we found Jong Wah. We love the food!  We have tried the other restaurants in the area, but we always return here. We are big fans of the orange chicken and their egg foo young can't be beat in the valley that we've found.  We are regular delivery patrons of this awesome restaurant.
The online ordering is a great feature, but they really need to quicken the pace of their service.
Tasty in that oily, gonna-mess-you-up-tomorrow sense of the word. Inexpensive and generous portion sizes. Had the family meal of 3 entrees, rice and lo mein for 4 people for $20. General chicken, pepper beef, and pork spare ribs - not the most authentic perhaps and maybe that's why I'm only so-so on the place, but we've only ourselves to blame for the selections.
I have a new fridge.
Temporal cooking at its best! I can't remember how many times I've ordered and the food was out before the water was... you definitely get a LOT of food for the price, and everything I have tried has been awesome.
While living in the Netherlands (where Chinese food is even worse than Phoenix) we learned that good Chinese restaurants have two menus, one for the casual Chinese eater looking for a step up from Panda Express and Chinese buffets and one menu for the die hards, native Chinese food eaters.  Often these menus are not even in English (or Dutch as it were).
We ordered lettuce cups, wontons, spring rolls & a couple beers. The food was delicious & they were all large portions.
Go here if there are no other options or you haven't had Chinese food in a while.
Nothing to write home about, the chicken seems microwaved and the appetizers are meh. I've been there a few times, I live in the area and its really hard to find good Chinese food. If your looking for a quick oriental fix I'd say go for it.. otherwise look elsewhere.
The Ma po tofu dish I picked last time for dinner was particularly awful and bland. Some cheap store bought tofu lightly fried with some soy sauce. If it wasn't enough, I got somewhat sick off of it too. How do you poison someone with a tofu dish? I guess this place is good at sucking every way possible.
A watery egg drop soup comes with the lunch special. A crunchy but skinny veggie egg roll with thick sweet and sour sauce is also party to the lunch special. I got the kung pau beef it was spicy and yummy fresh onions and green bell peppers that were good and not over cooked. The accompanying noodles were over cooked and turning into mush the fried rice was well just kind of bland and boring.  The staff was very attentive. Not bad in a pinch, but there are better fastfood chinese places.
As for the service, it's normal to me.  I'm used to them not smiling and kissing my ass because that's not how it's done in any restaurant I visited throughout Asia or back home.  If you want them to cater to you hand and foot, visit a five star restaurant.  Despite their "attitudes", they serve quickly, clear the table as you eat, and drink refills come quick, too.  
I was very pleased with my meal here. I have the Mongolian beef bowl and it was delicious. Also got some pot stickers on the side.. They weren't the best I've had but dipped in some sweet and sour and was good to go.
I like their orange and sesame chicken so far. Im really picky with food so i think they're doing a great job. The workers always keep the place clean and they are never too busy to refill your water cup. My cup was only halfway through and they go ahead and fill it up again. I really like that because i hate it when my glass is empty and i have to wait 10 minutes for someone to come by so i can ask for some water and they end up taking several more minutes before giving it to me. So thumbs up for the customer service! They are very nice and friendly so i am never uncomfortable ordering my food. i forgot to mention that their house special fried rice is pretty good too! Cheap price for good food. I give you 5 stars  keep up the good work!
One thing I would not recommend here are the wonton soup.  They were really doughy and didnt really have any filling in it.  Other then that everything else I've tried is great.
1st incidence: I ordered a dish that is pretty much tasteless. I asked them  to bring the salty level to same as the Minced pork noodle dish. Their respond is why don't you just add more soy source yourself.
Terrible chicken was old texture was odd and the food smelt foul!
Although the staff was friendly and the language was not a barrier for me as it was for others, the food I got was not very good. After I ordered the General Tso's Chicken, the woman turned on the fryer and, without waiting for the oil to heat up, she put in the chicken and my crab rangoon. Therefore, when I ate the food it wasn't crispy as a good General Tso's/crab rangoon  should be. Another thing that I noticed was that the chicken that she put in the fryer was sitting on the counter in the heat. *note: she hadn't fried any in quite some time which is why she had to turn the fryer on. The person that said the food was too sweet was right. Even though the menu said *spicy for my meal, there was no "zip" at all. Take it for what it's worth, but I know I will be looking for another restaurant to get my take out from now on.
However, once we got our food, it was yummy!  Mongolian beef was spicy, but not too spicy. It was light on the beef though. The chicken fried rice was great! Huge platter! Egg rolls were huge! Others in our party got moogoo guipan, happy family, coconut shrimp and egg flower soup. They all said they were good too!

YELP 365 CHALLENGE-(59/365)
If you grow tired of those neighborhood Chinese buffets, come here for a change as you can easily spend less than $40 for 5 people on a family-style dinner set.  If you want to go a la carte, the highest item is $7.  Lunch specials run around $5-6 for a full plate of big portions!
Items ordered off their menu are plentiful, tasty, price-worthy, and of a better quality than their Panda-like line AND they deliver! Which is especially awesome due to the light rail construction on 19th & Northern.
THIS PLACE IS NOW CLOSED.
My brother from another Asian nation, Andy T. told me about a new Chinese resto that opened up doing a buy one get one free promo so we decided to try it. It's in a older shopping center and inside is quite cute and immaculately clean. 
5 stars for naming their restaurant after me.
I came to HK Star for a family birthday dinner.
It was ok, the delivery was very good, 15 mins tops. Maybe because I have a Chinese last name...they are skimpy in the shrimp, the terriaki chicken was too saucy and the rice was dry. The veggies were good and so was the beef lo mein. If I were to go there again l would stick with the lo mein dishes. Large portions for a good price.
Ordered take out (for pick up) and was very happy with my service, timeliness, and of course, taste.
Went to lunch with coworkers on a Thursday, it was a last lunch outing for one of our coworkers who is leaving the company and one of my coworkers  suggested we get Chinese food, now still being new to our area we didn't know where to go, so whipped out the Yelp App and searched for Chinese food near here and found Panda Garden, so the place was set and off we went.
The service was awesome. I never had empty glass although since only one in the restaurant might not be best gage of the service. Still being the only one in for lunch they were very attentive too service. One thing that found odd was had no music going in the restaurant and since only one in for lunch felt awkward being so quite here pin drop. They do have couple televisions in the restaurants but neither of them was on. I like the decor inside it has nice relax vibe. 
My trusty Yelp app reminded me I was in the neighborhood and not only did we recently read about this restaurant in the local paper, but Paul Y. was raving about place to the Husband.  
This location stays busy so food is usually fresh and hot.
I make sure to stop for dinner at the China Grill every time I am in Las Vegas.  I appreciate that the staff are very upfront about it being a Chinese fusion restaurant.  The duck salad and long green beans is to die for!  I have always had wonderful and very attentive service.  I'm not a seafood fan, but I've been there enough to hear other patrons wave about the lobster.  Bring your appetites!  It is very easy to over order if there are only two or three people.  The portions are huge.  The last couple of times there were only two of us.  The duck salad and skirt steak did us in.  (They usually will recommend a vegetable too).  Their dessert are a must try.  Delicious!!!  The chocolate fortune cookies add a little class to the end of a fantastic meal.  I saw on a Las Vegas rating show that the bathrooms were rated #1 in Vegas.  (This is huge for someone like me who has a public restroom phobia!!!).  They are unique and always clean.  I always send people back there to check them out.  You can't leave the restaurant without seeing them.  I guess they have become another 'free' attraction!
For our first visit to Golden Dragon we met some friends here for dinner who recommended it.  We walked in and I felt as if I were in a time warp, back to the Brooklyn Chinese restaurants of my youth.  Well, not my youth youth, since a morsel of Chinese cuisine never touched my lips until I was 12.  Every other Brooklyn Jewish family in the golden days of Brooklyn (oh, I forgot that now Brooklyn is trendy, so it's someone else's golden days),  "went Chinese" on Sunday.  It was The Law.  But my family was Kosher, even at home.  No Chinese food on paper plates for us.  But I was a rebel, so the first chance I got, at my friend Regina's sophisticated Birthday Dinner Party, I ate the forbidden fruit.  Regina's mom promised not to tell mine, though she'd promised her that she'd provide Kosher salami for me.  Yeah, right.  Nothing like feeling different from your peers when you're 12.  And it was good.  And I was hooked.
The hostess seated us, and our old waiter came over to us.  He was so not friendly, we had to laugh a few times at him.  He literally acted like he hated us and we were bothering him by sitting at his table.  Then again, he was an old Chinese man, so maybe that's how they do it in Beijing??  I don't know...but he was pretty gruff.
One of my favorite restaurants, never go wrong with this place. The lettuce wraps are a MUST TRY, even if you're not a huge fan wraps, this one is amazeballs! The Orange chicken is amazing! This location in particular is pretty quite, not too much traffic and wait is normally not as long as others in town. If you love fruity, blended drinks, try the Nutty Uncle w/whip cream-SHIT"S THE BOMB! It's no longer on the menu but they will make for you if you ask. ;-)
My family has been coming here as long as I can remember. This is the freshest tastiest Chinese food I've ever had. The staff is super competent and the food is always fast and hot. Hunan chicken, Wong Jo chicken, sizzling rice soup, beef with broccoli, Mongolian beef, but most importantly, IMPERIAL THREE DELIGHTS SPICY. Used to be tom running the show but now it's Henry, he has even brought the food to my car when picking up with the kids. They have never gotten an order wrong and I have never had a bad meal. Wongs is a staple in our family. 
Picked up some food to go here. For a quick meal on the cheap this place isn't that bad. However, it wasn't very good either. We got the dinner combo b and everything on the pupu platter was either bland or dry. The fried rice and garlic shrimp were actually pretty good.
Great Chinese restaurant with a wide variety of food to choose from. My favorite dish is the chicken chow fun with gravy and the Portuguese pork curry over rice. The dessert selection is also worth trying. The owner Wendy is very down to earth and cares about her customers. If you are from Vegas or visiting from out of town I recommend visiting this place. It's about a 10 minute drive west from the strip located near Chinatown off of Jones (between Spring Mountain & Desert Inn in the 168 Supermarket shopping center).
First time trying this place and it was really good.  Was skeptical cause of the building, but the menu looked good and prices were reasonable.  Ordered take out and had a Orange Chicken Dinner special....portions were huge..lots of chicken...three times more than you would get at Panda express..the Sauce was not spicy at all...which was disapointing
I rated this place as moderate in price, but that's only because I always order two dishes or more, because I love having left overs for the next day. The food is actually extremely well priced, especially the lunch menu, which you can get a great dish and rice and I believe an egg roll for under $7. 
My mom and I were waiting for massages next door and decided to grab a bite here at Chopstix.
Nice local place, very fast service, friendly, with decent food. Wonton and Hot-and-Sour soup are very good. Crispy orange beef  is tasty, General Tso's chicken is very good, and the fried rice is flavorful with lots of meat. Not gourmet food, but an excellent place for some quick tasty Chinese food.
Service was friendly and helpful.  Ambiance: Bare, but clean.  Dining area and mens' room: Clean.   Conveniently adjacent to light rail stop.  Open until 10PM.  Be warned of easy-to-miss narrow driveway between buildings off north side of Apache. 
My sister and I dined here a while back and had a pretty satisfying meal. We loved the atmosphere with the thousands of goldfish surrounding you. My sister ordered the tomato and egg flower soup, which was okay, not great and we both got the eggplant noodles. These were delicious, the only problem being not nearly enough sauce. We would have asked for more, except for the server being non-existent until we were finished. It was a good place for lunch, the prices were decent for Las Vegas, especially since it was inside Ceasars. I would go again, and just ask for extra sauce before ordering.
  My favorite China Garden dishes are the pepper steak, shrimp with lobster sauce, and shrimp chop suey. 
Tried 2 years ago and forgot about it.  Recently been visiting family in the West valley, and all the sudden, I've gotten to try many dishes from here.  The Chinese roasted white pork and Singapore noodles are particularly good.
I love this place. There are only a few places in town that have salt & pepper pork. This is one of the best places for it. I love the fried rice with the fish. As far as Chinese food goes this place ranks up there in my top places to eat. 
Located in a strip mall, this hole in the wall mom and pop restaurant is quaint and simply decorated with pictures of the menu items and hanging red lanterns.  Of course, the very clean fish tank is something you can't miss when you walk in.
FANTASTIC AND AUTHENTIC BEIJING CUISINE!!!!
Service-  abrupt/borderline rude
Good service. You can definitely get better hotpot in Edinburgh.
The pictures of the dishes on the wall threw me off to start... and the saran-wrapped chairs really made me wonder.  However, for $3.33 they gave me a huge amount of spicy chicken, which I barely could finish (but wasn't going to waste!) As far as value, this kicks the kung pao out of Panda or any chain Chinese... 
I will definitely keep returning, and hope that they continue to provide delicious cheap Chinese food.
I was looking forward to trying their Chop Suey at a REAL Chop Suey House.  My mind was filled with tastes and textures of fresh veggies, bean sprouts with still a bit of crunch. maybe a little fresh green pepper, celery  as long as it wasn't that canned stuff mom made it had to be better .  I ordered the #2 Dinner Combo (fried shrimp, egg fu young, pork chop suey and rice) and had them add an egg roll.  
Food was so bad we left without eating. If you like these fake Chinese buffets, then ignore this review. 
Scallion pancakes - absolutely loved. Simple but super tasty.  Will be a staple on subsequent trips.
Curry chicken rice - $4.95
Now, my five stars are based on my own tastes, which I will admit are very Americanized. This is not the most authentic Asian diner, so if you're looking for a true taste of China you might look elsehwere, but if you're looking for a true taste of Chinatown make the call.
I liked it - food was tasty, service was great, ambiance was comfy and cool, nice wine selections.
I didn't order anything to drink but did ask for water. The lady working there gave me a cup of water and when I asked for another (since I was sharing this meal), she said only one water per customer :(.
Went there on Saturday night to get some food to go. On of the worst Chinese Buffets I've seen. Half of the trays were empty and other half were almost empty. Very little selection. The worst pay is the take out prices: $10.50 to get a to go box(should be under 2lb) and 40 cents for every ounce after, WTF is that!!! So we just went somewhere else that night and didn't dine there at all. Bottom line: EAT SOMEWHERE ELSE.
I love the Wynn and it's great to have a go to spot for good food and service without being extra expensive.
It's Christmas day and my mom just picked me up from the airport. We're en route to our hotel, but I complain that I'm starving and my grandma has to use the restroom after the 3.5 hour drive from LA. A quick exit off the freeway leads us to the Palace Station. We took a quick walk around and see an ominous sign that simply says "chinese food" with an arrow underneath. You can't go wrong with Chinese food right??
I love that this place was cheap and affordable.  
Went for our first visit on Christmas Day evening. Place was packed! - about a one hour wait for a table and about 45 minutes to get served. Worth every minute!!  Best Chinese food in the greater Phoenix area.  Lots of Yelp reviews panned the service but ours was great even under very hectic conditions.  If you're looking for ambiance this is NOT the place to go.  But if you're looking for outstanding Chinese cooking I suggest you give this place a try.  You won't be disappointed.
--well staffed to handle all 30 tables promptly and courteously
Awesome americanized Chinese food (which is what I like - guess i'm not a real foodie). Lunch has it: big portion, hot, quick and cheap ($6). The owner and waitress is super sweet and efficient.   Best of all this place is consistent - good every time ( I have been over 10x)! Not sure why consistency is always an issue when looking for good asian but this place is def the best!
ATMOSPHERE
Must have's:
We will definitely be back, but ALWAYS have the coupon, it's on their menu.
BEST OF LAS VEGAS REVIEW JOURNAL 2012
This place has authentic cantonese flavors. 
My favorite is the sesame chicken special but they have great tofu options of you're into that.  They say 15 minutes for pick regardless of the day or time but usually have it ready is just over 10.  Anything off the full dinner menu could easily be split by two or be saved for leftovers.  Or if you are a big guy like me or just downright hungry, you could easily power through the whole thing.
3) Tao Garden
I wish this was a place close to my house. It was so so so so so so so soooooooo good. I had the tasting menu and was not disappointed. 
Egg soup is exquisite. 
Like I said this is not chinatown but with certain friends we do not have that option.  So I enjoyed my meal and really wanted to share about being able to order off certain other menus in there area!
I like this place simply because it is oddly placed and very underrated. 
I love this place! It has UNDOUBTEDLY the best orange chicken in town! Just a little more spicy, which I cannot have, and it adds that flavorful kick. The brown rice and cream cheese rangoons are to die for! We go there once a week!
Ordered the hot and sour soup which was very good, if a touch too vinegary (my wife thought it was perfect). We also ordered the Kung Pao Chicken and Mongolian Beef and that's where the problems came in. 
My boyfriend and I love this place and have been several times! Everything comes out quick weather it is to go or dine in. The same woman is always waiting tables and seems to usually be the only one doing so, still she is prompt and polite! The menu is rather large and includes combination dinners that come with soup, an entree, an egg roll, and a crab Rangoon for 8.95 or 9.95! The food is what you would expect from an Americanized Chinese restaurant but everything is always tasty and hot. I am sure we will be back again soon!
She slapped me on the shoulder saying 'We have Manapua AND Pork Hash!" I hadn't seen it on the menu, but its posted along the back of the restaurant along with other off the menu items, such as your ghetto style Malasadas(Fried Pilsbury Biscuit dough) so for any of  you looking for Manapua or Pork Hash, they serve it at Noodle Palace. Next time, I'll take an extra 5 minutes to read their other off the menu items and to avoid another possible slap....ALOHA!!!
Spicy Chicken
Food is very good, lunch specials affordable, and you can get an extra soup instead of the eggroll, which I prefer.
Pork Lo Mein
We decided to go here because we had a discount and we wanted to try something different.  We decided on the 'chefs tasting menu'.  It was wonderful and so was the service we received.  We were treated special the minute we walked thru the door.  I am not a big Chinese fan but this was well worth the price.  We started with a sampling of two appetizers, the chicken lettuce wrap and a spicy prawn dumpling.  Both of these were hot and fresh.  The first two appetizers were followed by a second plate of a pot sticker and honey glazed ribs.  Our main course was spice scallops and wok fried pepper tenderloin that came out hot and fresh.  Which now days it is very unusual to have your food much hotter than the serving dish since so many places not reheat their entrees.  We were also served lobster fried rice and mixed Chinese vegetables.  Finally our desert was a trio of pastries.  We had a chocolate bananan torte, crème brulee, and a wonderful cold parfait.  They were small bites but the perfect compliment to larger meal.   We will certainly go back.
Wowsers.  Like, jeepers, but WOWSERS.  Have you ever watched the movie Ratatouille?  There is a scene where, Ego, the food critic takes a bite of Remy's ratatouille and it wafts him back to his mother's kitchen.  Well, one bite of the food here and I had wafted back  to Flushing, New York.  We had the whole steamed sea bass from the tank.  We asked for a large fish.  It comes at market price.  They price is based on the weight of the fish. They cook it up with a soy sauce, ginger, scallion juice that is out of this world.  Mmmm, mmmmm, mmmmm.   We also asked for authentic chinese greens and whatever they brought us was outstanding (it was not bok choy, yu choy, chinese broccolli or anything similar to those three).  I would have asked what they were if I had not done carry out.  Our last dish was like a beef - bo luc loc dish.  Very very tender.  On the drier side.  I'm not a huge fan of sauceless meats, but it was very well done.  Bravo.   I fully agree with a previous review that this may be the most authentic chinese food in the valley. 
We then waited soooooooo long for the Ha Cao to come out. The Ha Cao was Okay in my opinion. The shrimps inside were very fresh and cooked just perfect; however, the skin outside was a lil over-cooked, so it was kinda powdery and a lil bit mashed. The good Ha Cao skin should be a bit chewy. 
The owner always remembers me and since I'm independent a bridal gown designer she always asks what new gowns I've made and takes the time to sit and talk with me when it's not so busy.
I found the servers to be appropriately enthusiastic, something that is a staple at most teppanyaki joints.  Each time, I get a mixed dinner which contains some combination of steak, chicken, lobster, shrimp.  I find at Lillie's the chefs are more skilled at cooking the steak to the requested temperature.  Also, my shrimp/lobster has never been tough or overcooked.  
I like the place. Pretty cozy. Chinese theme even the music. Good customer service. I would go back next time.
I updated my review from 4 stars to 3 stars.  The last time I went here for the BF's birthday the service was slow and the food was mediocre.  I guess having gone to Hong Kong and Taiwan has spoiled my taste for Chinese food state side.  Also our bill was almost $350 for two (including tax and a 20% tip).  I may have had a more satisfying meal at Panda Express (and more money in my wallet).  Sad to say.  I do want to try their Fountain's Brunch which is held every Sunday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. for $55 bucks.  Not too bad considering that the buffet features assorted dim sum, fresh oysters and seafood, Peking duck, assorted western breakfast items, and more.
i will always have to come here at least once every time i visit Vegas! an alternative for drunk late night eating steak & eggs! it's not the fanciest place so don't expect a whole lot. the prices are a bit over priced for a chinese place but its Vegas!
The scene is a hurried and the staff are not entirely friendly, but for the prices of those fried morsels I'm willing to tolerate a less than stellar overall experience. Come in with low expectations (with the exception of the salt and pepper selections) and you will leave satisfied.
Even stuff like their pu-pu platter is head and shoulders above anything else I've had in the valley, just because of the superior ingredients and cooking. The beef skewers are tender, succulent pieces of quality meat. The "chicken in paper" wrapped in foil is juicy and savory in that special Cantonese way. Their char siu is tender and delicious. Nothing is sickly sweet or soaked in oil. 
We come here a lot and the food is never consistent. Sometimes it's really salty. Other times it's too spicy or not spicy enough. There must be several different cooks because the sauce is never the same either. We still like the adventure of what we may get today. Stop for quick bite on the way home. If you tried it and didn't like it you may want to try again, you may be surprised at how much better or different the next time may be. 
5 stars for the dinner menu,  but only 3 stars for the breakfast buffet.  
I stumbled upon this place by accident, meant to go to another noodle cafe joint but the yelp search engine led me here, lol. Nevertheless, I was pleasantly surprised. Can't say enough how diverse their menu is. I expected a variety of noodles but they had some great fried rice and pasta as well. They served a small portion of peanuts while we were waiting which was pretty cool. I had the Wonton Noodle and the Yum Tom Goong Fried Rice, which comes with an assortment of fish, veggies and egg strips. While the Wonton was decent, I thought the noodles and broth were just meh. The Wonton dumplings are a little chewy and unusually large. the Tom Goong dish, on the other hand, was great. It has a spicy yet sweet taste, very unique. The value of the dishes are excellent, ranging from $5 tapas to $10 for a regular dish. The service was friendly, food comes out in a few minutes and never had to wait for a refill of water. Excellent place to go during lunch or dessert.
It's the type of place that serves delicious, neighborhood style food. The flavors are wonderful. It's one of those places that start you off with hot tea, which I love! The lunch specials are super cheap. You can probably eat here for less that some place like Panda Express and you'll get better food!
If I could give half stars, I'd be giving 4.5, but because of the few hiccups, I'm giving it a four. Would definitely recommend this place!
First, it's reasonably authentic foods if you ask for the "black" menu to order the real Szechwan foods. Second, it helps if you know the waiter and he can prepare something totally off the menu (only if you know what you wants obviously).
We decided on the spare ribs to start. We got 4 small ribs on a plate, complete with hot wet towels to dry the bbq sauce off our messy hands. Now the ribs were pretty small compared to take-out ribs, but the meat coming off these ribs was plentiful and more than you'd get at a take-out place. So it was like small bone, LOTS of meat. We were thrilled and they were very delicious.
Overall its not too bad for the price but definitely not great.  Ok if youre nearby and just want cheap food to fill up on but besides that Id probably pass in the future.
Oh and the waitress does speak good English, however, you wont find many Caucasians frequenting this place. That means the food is pretty authentic!
Been looking for a place like this.  Great Asian lunch specials!  
I should have taken her advice.  It wasn't bad, just somewhat lacking in...umm... flavor.  The crispy egg and pork which topped it tasted good enough but the--I don't know--gruel tasted like unsalted, unsweetened rice pudding.  I know critics of this review will claim that congee IS unseasoned rice pudding.  I'll give you that.  In praise, the other two dishes were good and the prices reasonable, with each plate costing between three and four quid, putting it around $18 Canadian for the whole meal.  
4. Szechuan Style Sizzling Sliced Pork, 
The food isn't the best that I've ever had, but given that it's Madison, WI, it would be difficult to find a better place. But that's not to take anything away from DumplingHaus. The food is delicious, and I wish there was several of them in the Twin Cities! 
Trying to find East coast style Chinese food here in the Phoenix area can be tricky.  The closest I've come is Jade Palace my two favorite locations are Scottsdale road and Pinnacle Peak road and the one on Shea and 92nd street.  Jade has all the traditional Cantonese dishes that I grew up on in NYC, the service is excellent and the food consistent.  So when I'm in the mood for Chinese I head to Jade Palace
We frequent here often, the ease of ordering online combined with the taste of fresh cooked food keep us coming back for more.
The rest of lunch menu (11a-5p) offer some very authentic HK style appetizers, rices, noodles, and congee. You won't be wrong ordering from this section. In the dinner menu section (offer full day), there are some bigger Cantonese entree dishes. 
I love this place. "Kung Pow" Shrimp is to die for.
-Food was average, a bit on the extreme salty side.
Pretty damn good. Not many authentic Chinese food places in town that aren't "fast food". I got the family dinner option C. Every item was delicious.
I think they skimp on the entrees, which sucks, especially when you're paying an extra $1.25 for the "premium" entrees, but...it is what it is.  
This is one of my favorite restaurants in the Green Valley area. I am consistently happy with my food, which says a lot.
Oh yeah, the Jasmine Tea, Hot and Sour Soup, and Lychee Martinis are great!
I kind of enjoyed doing dim sum here though.
- large portion of orange chicken, fried rice and chow mein!
Check them out!
Lesson learned, if I'm craving a good stir fry with shrimp, shell out the extra cash for PF Changs.
*Seabass in a clay pot with tofu - the seabass was slimy and chewy, pretty nasty imo, but most of the people at our table were loving it.
We went this place because it's advertisement for sezchuan dish on the chinese newspaper. However  I have to say it's some of worst food I had, plus the place is really empty even during prime dinner time. I guess that's the first sign of trouble. If you're going please only order sezchuan dish they are edible but by all mean STAY AWAY from SEAFOOD, they're not fresh and stale.
*Ambiance: The restaurant is pretty spacious, however, some of my dishes weren't very clean prior to eating and I had to switch them out. But that's pretty typical of most Chinese restaurants, so it wasn't a big deal. 
We went in on a Sunday for dinner and we were the only non-asian people in the whole place (Great sign!!).
Yummy stuff!
Spicy Prawns - it was not what I expected as this is a green curry dish.
Chicken wings were OK. Usually places deep fry the wings. This place coats them in a batter and then deep fries them. The batter didn't really add anything and I would have preferred them without. The fried rice was OK, except for the occasional piece of cartilage. My husband liked the spicy pork thing he ordered and the garlic chicken was really good, but not really garlicky. And, the beef and broccoli was just...gross. It kinda turned my stomach to where I couldn't really eat the other items. Neither one of us could even look at it. I didn't try it. It went directly into the trash.
Service was pretty good since my friend was a regular and I think they know her by name.  Oh the perks!  What I like about this place is that it reminds me of those old Chinese restaurants back in LA.  No uniforms and the staff ate their lunch next to us :)  The decors could use a modern touch, but the tackier the better I guess - Enjoy!
Good service great egg rolls, good dumplings, pepper beef was my main Meal which was the first time I had it so I have nothing to compare it too but very yummy! Soup they actually made mine special since I can't eat shrimp.  So they earn my future business. I'm pretty sure this is a family own business. They restaurant is outdated and needs TLC. That's really the only things that might be an issue with your experience.
I had some fried noodle and some drink made from tapioca which I couldn't recall the names and both were not good. My dining companion had a plate of seafood noodle and it smelled so fishy. Not to mention, cuts of the seafood were way too big. 
A favorite for my circle of friends for years, Ming's never disappoints. Food so fast, you'd expect a shy on quality, but it never happens! The staff is always polite and attentive and the food is sooooo goooddd.
Bistro might be a little much --- HOng Kong Bistro is a little Chinese restaurant in a shopping center.  The owner, Michelle, always give us a warm welcome and the staff always does everything possible to assure satisfaction, refilling beverages and checking back.   Once I couldn't decide between the Garlic Chicken and Cashew Chicken, so Michelle said they would add garlic to the Cashew Chicken; that is now my own signature dish!  My husband loves the Hot & Sour Soup and the Beef Chow Fun.  We upgrade and for $1.25 more, we get soup, appetizers and fried rice; what a deal!  Prices are cheap, portions huge and the service is friendly!  $20 for dinner for 2 and we always leave with leftovers; it's the best deal in town!
it's interesting to read all these less than avg reviews. i wonder if they are chinese. 
It was a satisfying bowl of real Chinese comfort food. This discovery was just in time for the cold weather ahead. 3 stars for now but I will upgrade my stars once I've had a chance to try other items from their menu.
2. The Yelp photos donated by members make the dishes appear larger than they are. Most of the sauteed dishes like the Kung Pao chicken and Egglant were not big but then some like the Water Boil chicken was rather big.
My fiance and I were staying at the Luxor and decided to go here for dinner. While the place looked nice (pretty decor), I did note while there that the place was never full. Now I know why. 
They also have ice cream, but I didn't want to have any. It was a strange inclusion. 
I had the honey dipped chicken wings. They were good, but very soggy atleast the sauce was good. However, I would have liked it if there were more sesame seeds. :) The BBQ Pork Slices are okaaaay... but I've had better and I don't think I'll be ordering it again. He had Sweet and Sour Pork and it was GOOOOOOD!! The best I've had in a while! Very yummy, I wound up eating half of it! lol, as my Orange Chicken wasn't that great. It was soggy and too sweet. I didn't care for it. The fried rice was good, he loved the crab puffs and I loved the egg rolls. 
Here's the biggest thing, and not to stereotype, but I'm going to, I've found that service can sometimes be less than desirable at Chinese restaurants. This place puts the stereotype to rest. For a fast food-ish type restaurant they were very attentive when dining in. Provided refills. Checked on us numerous times. When ordering to go we asked how many crispy won tons you get on the side because we had 4 people eating, they decided to throw in free pork won tons "to make sure everyone has enough food." Outstanding!
The dishes  ..........are not lacking in sauce. 
Dropped by over the weekend just to check them out.  The menu is not extensive, the restaurant is small (not much room for dining in if you are coming with a large party), but they are supposedly one of the top Chinese restaurants in the country.
Second only to her other restaurant, Flo's Asian Kitchen, five miles down the road. I really wish she'd open a location closer to ASU, where I lived. Three of her four locations are all a stone's throw from one another, all in Scottsdale. They're all excellent, and all half an hour from where I live(d). The exception is the airport location, and don't even get me started on that mess...
Try this restaurant for a late night dinner, they never rush you and always make you feel like you are a dinner guest in their home.  We had the pleasure of chatting with Daniel, who is in management and was very informative about the cuisine and also about things happening around town.  
My wife and I tried takeout at Dragon Palace a few weeks ago and were really pleased. We ordered one of their specials, the house beef, and it was AWESOME! It honestly got better with every bite and we talked about it for days. We also got the hot n sour soup but frankly it was neither hot nor sour, but somewhat tasty (wouldn't order again).
A very typical Chinese business: you either get acceptable service for a low price or you get really shitty service for a low price. Unfortunately, I got the shitty service.
I tend to order a lot of fried, filled foods when I order chinese, and this place did it right!  I had crab rangoon, pork filled wontons, and an eggroll, and all were fantastic!  The eggroll was gigantic and very crisp, and the rangoon and wontons were crisp with a good amount of filling.  Usually when I order these things, the rangoon is soft and mushy, and the wontons are mostly breading.  So, I was excited that this was not the case.  
Desert Jade has very affordable prices and the portions are great.  The staff is incredibly nice, friendly, gracious and accommodating and the service is second to none. In addition, Desert Jade offers terrific lunch and dinner specials. 
If I have to complain about something i would mention that the low-mein is very greasy/oily. I have avoided ordering it my last 3 times although it is normally my favorite thing to eat. I have a feeling the cooks in the kitchen aren't Chinese (dated a girl for 3 years that worked at a Chinese restaurant) 
I like to admit that this was my first visit to this eatery. I feel the prices are way to overpriced. It's a trendy hangout for the Vegas tourist crowd. I'd give this plaxe a solid 3 with very little to offer in the way of flavor to the food. This is the typical tourist trap place if your looking for one.
I really like the decor. White swirls cover the entire ceiling and walls and create rounded corners. Several large goldfish tanks add motion and orange colors to the white surroundings. The orange and white is mirrored in the polka dots of the glasses. The orange is also found on the hostess and in the uniforms of the waiters.
This place have potential to be TOP authentic Chinese restaurant  if they are willing to spend more that a nickle for decors and do some clean up.
I used to ditch 4th period (I went to PHS) every few weeks and go to Big Heng with my boyfriend. 
Best Orange Chicken I've ever had! We've only eaten takeout from this restaurant so I can't comment on the service. I can say that they are quick with takeout orders and the place appears clean. Did I mention that they have the best Orange Chicken!?!!
This place sucks.... We place a order for delivery for over 40 dollars and we were missing some food. So we called them to get order order correct and they refused, so now to get our money back we have to send all of the food back. This place is a joke.... Never order from here
This is one of my favorite restaurants. I've been here with my friends a few times and I've never been disappointed. I would recommend trying their seafood soup and beef chow fun.
The decor is pretty spartan, but not as spartan as Yun Nan Garden next door.
I am uphauled, I used to like this place until...............................................
Atmosphere-wise, this place lacks severely in that department, but who cares if the food is good. I like this place for take out.
Ate here a couple times during a long stay in Vegas.  
Wonton noodle soup- that is the only thing we order all the time.
I love Tasty Joes! This place is a wonderful little Thai place for takeout during the week. It's fresh, fast and can be extremely flavorful if you ask for the right hotness. I see some reviews on here comparing it to Thai restaurants, let's not compare apple to oranges. This is in the same category as Panda Express but is higher quality, better tasting, fresher and is cooked in front of you to your preferences. Delicious.
 As a regular fast food customer, I rate Panda Express highly. My three plate dinner including chow mein, kobari beef topped off with hot mustard, and fried rice was the bomb. And the portions of food was decent.
             Ginger and egg fried rice
We had real plates and cutlery and both the cashew chicken and Kung Pao chicken had fresh ingredients with great flavor. We really enjoyed the egg rolls, which also tasted fresh.  The chicken and corn soup aka egg drop soup was the only negative. It was flavorless. Adding hot mustard, salt, and pepper helped, but not enough to make it worth it.
Fin
I know what to expect at Changs: glorified Panda Express at 3x the price, and if I had gotten that I would have been A-ok with it. Instead we got served up slop with a snooty attitude and terrible service. Our large party decided to order a few of the '2 for $40' Chang's feast specials. Pretty much you get soup, an app, entree and small dessert for two people for $40. Our party of eight told our server that we were doing the Changs Feast and his heart just sank. He probably wanted us to order a la carte to jack up the check, but after he took our orders he disappeared. We had to wave down bussers and other servers to simply get refills.
Dumplings... Great
So I decided to give this place a second chance like I said I would... 
Roasted Chilean Sea Bass with Chinese honey - This was one of the best dishes of the evening, a succulent piece of fish roasted in honey. The earthiness and texture of fried mushrooms was the main accompaniment, but the real star was the rich, moist fish.
If  I found myself here again, I would pass on the egg roll and the chop suey and stick to something fried like sweet and sour something or some apps. Maybe I will try the soup next time.
Chop Chop Wok is located close to my home, and has some of the better Chinese food in my area.  This place is more for take out, so don't bring a party of 50 or more!  All they have for seating is several small tables and a few tables that sit between 4-6 people.  Chop Chop Wok is definitely a small Mom & Pop type joint.  And with just the one nice lady running the entire front area, it is such.  We all know these little hole-in-the-wall places can offer up some good eats!
I come he quite a bit an the food is usually good but today was over the top POOR. What made me experience so bad was the cold ginger dish which I must have ordered twenty times before and always came out alright but to day not so much. It was RAW and I don't mean a little pink. The center still had a heart beat. I requested the dish to be taken back. When I received the new dish it was the same dish but with a few pieces taken out and slightly stirred around. Like it had been picked threw and just covered with a little more sauce. I was grossed out. I went to the bottom of the plate and STILL RAW.  Asked again for the dish to be taken back. This time when it came to us it was the same but the whole plate had been just thrown into the microwave. I did not touch it any more and I was still AWFUL plate of twice NUKED and sifted through chicken. DISGUSTING!!! It truly ruined my day. Then the check came and I was still expected to pay for the RAW TWICE NUKED GINGER CHICKEN. The waitress agreed it was really raw and explained that the chicken they used today was bigger. Ya so if you know that cook it longer DUH. I was so pissed I paid my bill and left. I was heart broken that a place I usually frequent had done me wrong. I feel sick to my stomach now and am really disappointed in you WO FAT. Minus Four STARS for serving RAW product and not having the decency to correct it.
Want to eat in Chinatown?   Well, you're in luck, Nee house is a little  Chinatown eatery situated in North Phoenix.  
Mr. Beijing is simply amazing. I got to know the new owners from my Mother in law. They have really improved the taste and quality. We ordered the Orange Chicken, Cirspy Beijing Wings, Chicken Fried Rice, Curry Noodles with Beef, Chicken, and Shrimp, and Iced Thai Tea to drink. 
I've eaten here the past three visits to Las Vegas will continue to dine at Beijing Noodle No. 9 on every Vegas trip.  Prices are reasonable, especially if you're a Total Rewards member.  Everything has been outstanding, from the food, to the service, to the ambiance.  The hand stretched noodles are to die for!  Best Chinese food I've ever had!  Don't miss:
Got the chicken lo mein. Paid nearly $10 and ended up throwing the take out in the trash after 3-4 bites:( not sure if I can give it a second chance. The staff was friendly on the plus side.
*I forgot to mention that their fried rice was the best I have ever had! Rice cooked to perfection with baby broccoli and other vegetables I didn't care about. Baby broccoli! Woo! 
I decided to try out this place for dinner. I ordered the Peking style roasted duck and beef chow fun. Both dishes were good but the only thing I need to gripe about is the Peking duck or more like the lack of Peking duck. They only brought out the skin of the duck and there was no duck meat. The dish that we got only consist of the buns, duck skin, scallions and sauce. What??! 
Excellent chinese food and service. Went here with my cousins after a mt.charleston trip- apparently my cousins are regulars and were greeted warmly. We had their lunch specials and chicken/beef bowls. I grew up eating panda express and this is ten times better, and fresher. Their veggies were nice and crisp: zuchinnis, carrots and broccoli. Yum. Their chicken was ok but I was in love with their beef. It wasnt too chewy and cooked just right with a mice balance of salty and savoriness. The meal concluded nicely with fortune cookies. My favorite was my uncle's fortune: 'you are pretty'.
I would probably return here again to try some of their other entrees which seemed unique compared to other Chinese restaurants.
Tasty, affordable, reliable. It's not gourmet, but it's fresh, clean Chinese for a great price! I'll be back soon :)
The orange chicken was overcooked, dry and the sauce was too mild.
(480) 990-8801. 
We had NO expectation with their food when we walked in here. We were just tired, hungry, and wanted some Asian food to fill us up. We thought their food cannot be compared with the authentic Asian food in NYC. 
 
They are fully commit ed to using as many local ingredients as possible, yes those Ostriches are from a Scottish Ostrich Farm!
-Servers constantly touching their faces and hair. 
I'm no cheap scape, but I know value when I see it. Here is our order: 
Got take-out. Very friendly staff, reasonable prices, good food. I will be back! 
The Wife and I decided to try DumplingHaus at Hilldale Mall for dinner last night, a brave decision since I've eaten more than my fair share of dumplings in China and haven't found any quite as good here in the States. Suffice it to say, we were VERY pleased with the experience.
The only good dish there is the Minced pork noodle and Pan fried dumpling. 
Our server was great and our busser was incredible. Water level was always above half and both as a team were super friendly.
The Food is good, say all you want about the details in the restrooms and the side rooms but the food is very good.  We ordered multiple items and they have some great dishes, my favorite is the lo mein (catonese style) the pork selections where also yummy.  
The Sliced Pork & Mushrooms with Hand-Pulled Noodles (normally prepared with Hand-cut noodles) was delicious.  The noodles has that great texture, nice bite or very "Q Q Q" if expressed in Taiwanese. It definitely is in a different league compared to noodles served with machine made noodles trucked over from SoCal.  There are also a lot of mushrooms in this dish.  (Recommended!)
I recommend any of the noodle or rice dishes - big dishes too. What is more impressive is the dim sum. They have it ready to steam and it comes out fresh. 
I owe it to Yelp for helping me find this place. I've been to the Smart and Final and Del Taco a gazillion times, but I never noticed the Bobo China in the same shopping center. Even If I had noticed it, I'm not sure I would have tried it. I am absolutely in love with this place. The lady who always helps me is very nice and pretty sarcastic which is pretty much how I am. 
Why oh why is Asian Express not closer to me? I would eat here so much more.. with it's incredibly affordable, vast options, and authentic deliciousness. I had the combo chow fun, and it's very rare that anybody gets it right (as far as I have tried previously anyways), and it was spot on. Sauce proportion was perfect ratio with amount of noodles and meat. Noodles had the right amount of stickiness and not stuck in annoying chunks.
Overpriced Asian fast food...
Being too distracted by the superbly cliche interior decorating, I failed to notice the menu posted on the window. So once I got to the counter, I was only able to browse for a few seconds before just randomly selecting whatever sounded good.
I ate here a few days ago upon the recommendation of a friend. To my surprise the food was unbelievable and so fresh! I had several items on the menu because i couldn't decide and all were very good. It's also a very inexpensive restaurant too. What a great little find. I think it's only been open for 3 weeks, but it's only a matter of time before the rest of the city catches on to this little gem. I highly recommend this to all you foodies out there!  Fresh noodles galore!!!!
Great food, service, and decent price. I would want to go here again, and possibly try other signature dishes too. The place has a very Asian theme to it. Nicely decorated & some fine Ming porcelains.
This has been the go to take out chinese food spot on xmas eve for years now but I've never been inside till last night. It's got a great atmosphere and the best chinese in town! 
The woman who takes the food orders is moody, or just plain rude. When you ask her questions she always replies with, "I told you.." then the blah blah part comes in. I love their General Chicken and Sesame Chicken. When I tried their teriyaki chicken, it was swimming in teriyaki sauce, which isn't even good, it was too salty. I really like this place because it's convenient, and I'd deal with a moody lady anytime just to have good food.
All in all The Shanghai Club is a real gem, chances are if it hasn't been directly recommended to you, you might never stumble upon it! 4 out of 5!
My family and I got up and go next door to HK Star! We get 5 stars services at HK Star.
You should know that I am not a fan of Chinese food. With that being said the food was okay. We got the vegetable lomein and the shrimp in lobster sauce. Lomein was ok shrimp not so much. Would I go back again? nah. I did like the ambiance though. The music was great, the service was great, and it was clean, etc.
Every time we've gone the place has been very peaceful. I like that it hasn't ever been very busy, it makes for a nice quiet meal. Even though the staff is usually eating at one of the tables, they're still very attentive and fill your glasses whenever they get halfway. 
  I think it's actually faster than Panda  where I always seem to get stuck behind the most indecisive people or worse the person throwing a huge party and has them cooking up a storm for a party tray or two.... And I swear some people act as if they never saw teriyaki chicken before in their life and take 3 hours to decide in that place! So before you die of old age waiting in line just check this place out, they'll have you cooked and ready by the time you'd even get to the register across the street! :) ( Not hatin' on Panda their staff is good, it's just the customers....)
We had the Pipa Duck, the Shanghai lamb tenderloin and the beef with Merlot as entrees and the Udon Noodles with duck as a side. All entrees were excellent. Nicely presented and a normal portion. Only the pipa was not that much. We all agreed that we liked the beef with Merlot most of all. very tender meat, nicely seasoned. The pipa duck was as remarked, a very small portion. Excellent flavours, but because it resembles Peking Duck so much I think we will not order that again. The Shangai lamb was also good, altough some peoplie might think it's a little hot. One member of the party suggested a Pinot Grigio as a wine to start with. We ended up choosing one from Italy and drinking this with the entire meal.
The food was just okay...  there was nothing spectacular about it.  Our table ordered pot stickers, hot and sour soup, beef with bitter melon, assorted BBQ, and chicken chow mein.
* Mongolian beef
Ok, I understand that in UK, everything is more expensive.  I get that, really I do.  But Chop Chop's price is jacked way up, even by UK standard in my opinion.  If the restaurant is going high end and has some kind of decor or having servers all dressed in Ming Dynasty getups, I might have understood it more.  But no, while it's not quite a hole-in-the-wall restaurant, it's by no means, invested in any high end decor.  And I would much rather dine in a humble hole-in-the-wall with a hot steaming bowl of noodle soup for 8 bucks anyway,... just saying, not sure how they justify charging so much for pork & veggie dumplings.  Maybe there is a general lack of this type of cuisine in Edinburgh?  I don't know.
There is a lot of bad Chinese food in Vegas. Rice n noodle is a pleasant surprise. Their Wonton soup is really good and is more than enough for 2 people. 
Had dinner with 7 friends here on a Sunday night. Service was prompt and timely. We shared 5 entree's between us, 2 rice and noodles. It was more than enough. The food was fantastic, highly recommend the Mongolian beef. Everything was amazing. Must try.
I walk in, empty. Owner-guy in an Adidas track suit is on the phone and point at the tables (like, go over there!). We sit down. And we wait for 10 minutes to get a drink. Still no menu. Wait another 5 minutes just for menus. Food drops and it's ok. Overall the food was better than the service.
Manchu WOK, enjoy my $27.00, im getting my enjoyment now wrighting about your dump instead of when I ate that mess you serve up.
They have a minimum order amount for delivery of $15. There is a $3 service charge and a 4 mile radius. The hours there are Sunday-Thursday 11-9:30, and Friday-Saturday 11-10.
- orange chicken made fresh. i saw them make it on the wok! 
Thai Panang Curry with beef: Very tasty, BF gobbled it up without much communication.  It wasn't exactly the flavor he was looking for, wanting more of the curry flavor, but it was good enough for him to finish it in record time.
just moving from one state to another and getting situated at home calls for a lot of take-out, so i figured... now's the time to really see what's up with these places that are generally new to the area too... (sort of.)
We came to China Grill in 2003 and loved it so much that we couldn't wait to go to the NYC location when we returned. That said, we booked a reservation for our first night back in Vegas and were looking forward to a great meal.
Only went here cause we got a $20 credit. Decent food, got the spider roll, Singapore noodles and shrimp fried rice.
Start off with the positive. Food was good. The service was terrible. Everything was slow. The waiter pushed us into a fixed course meal. I was assuming it was to get the meal out in a timely manner. Even with the fixed menu we were always waiting on the next course. My wine arrived as I finished the meal. Lots of excuses from the waiter when it really was not very crowded. With so many options around I would say take a pass.
I ordered via their online service which was easy to use and convenient. I picked up the food to avoid the issues some of the other reviewers had. In terms of the food, it was hit and miss. I got the beef egg foo young and egg drop soup with wontons. The beef in the egg foo young wasn't good at all: chewy, tasteless, and fatty. The egg itself was good, so I'll probably get the veggie egg foo young next time. The fried rice that came with it was really good. The egg drop soup was good but the wontons weren't. It was cheap meat just like the beef in the egg foo young.I'm still willing to try some of the other entrees to see what's good and what isn't.
Now let's breakdown the food: my girlfriend and I ordered the Poo Poo Platter as well as the Kungpow Shrimp and the Broccoli Beef. The Poo Poo Platter consisted of Crab Ragoons that were 90% cream cheese. Meh. The Egg Rolls were good smothered in chili garlic sauce and soy sauce, but they were some of the greasiest things I've ever eaten. Then there was a sweet pork thing on a skewer, not a ton of meat on it and I just wasn't a fan. There was this weird piece of chicken wrapped in tinfoil that seemed like it was baked in soy sauce and it was DELICIOUS. My favorite part of the whole meal. I would eat that again.The shrimp in the Kungpow Shrimp was good, but everything else kind of sucked. There was a ton of waterchesnuts in the Kungpow Shrimp and I hate waterchesnuts, but there was also a ton of undercooked zucchini that gave the dish a really crunchy texture. Ew. Also, the sauce on the kungpow shrimp wasn't even spicy. Maybe they gave me the wrong dish? I don't know. The beef in the broccoli beef was chewy and the sauce was sweet. My girlfriend liked it, but I didn't. I did like the Broccoli Beef better than the Kungpow Shrimp though. Also, the Broccoli Beef didn't heat up well and I didn't even bother to eat the Kungpow Shrimp.
4.  Most entrees are enough for two.
War wonton soup was really good. Mixed seafood platter is a really light dish with white sauce, the seafood was cooked really well so it wasn't too chewy. Overall happy dinner.
Usually get food here to-go, but if you do choose to eat in, they have good service, unless they're busy.
I really like the modern feel of it.  Probably the only reason why I gave it two stars.  The huge tanks of fish were cool, but they looked a little dirty inside, hope the fish weren't dying...and I liked the way the walls looked as well.
so why no 3 stars?  service was incredibly sub-par.  okay, not just sub-par, it was just plain bad.  for a high end place, i'd have expected far superior service, but alas, it was not the case.  all in all, i would never venture here again of my own accord.
I'm sorry, but when the crunchy noodles that come free with the meal are the best part of the meal, then you've got a problem.
*Wok Charred Mongolian Beef
I am giving them 5 stars because there is no other Chinese food here in Surprise that matches with them. We sometimes come in a big party (15-20) but has never waited for more than 15 minutes. 
I am not going back there. 
2 Familystyle Tofu..which was a horrible spices sauce over Tofu. 
I left this restaurant with a bad taste in my mouth but, it didn't come from the food.  it came from the manner in which we were treated.
The soup: I didn't order it but my mom did. I have I add it's awesome because the simple fact her noodles were literally tied in a knot. It was pretty nice touch. Impressive.
well worth returning to enjoy again.
great find... i thank John A for the review... the food was very good... the menu is one of the bigger menus i have seen at a chinese place... i went with 3 people and we got 4 main dishes... i would reccomend the lemon chicken and Hong Kong beef... both were excellent... the decor is kinda funky... like your grandmas house in the 60's... it is not priced too bad... i am defintaly going back...
As the meals go, these start at £3.90 and go up from here without really venturing beyond a fiver so it's certainly good value for money.  Whether you want to sit in or takeaway, this place is worth a visit.
I've had Happy Wok's Double Cooked Chicken lunch dish at least 40 times in the past few years and hand down, it is the best Chinese dish in Madison.  It has extremely fresh green peppers, onions and carrots to go with lean, never grisly white meat chicken, all in a sweet, tangy, garlicy sauce that is terrific. 
Chen & Wok on 7th street is the best!  Not only are the prices super low ($3-$4 ) the portions are huge! My boyfriend and I have been going there forever, and have never once had a bad experience.  The owners are wonderful, and the food is delicious. The only issue I have ever experienced is order accuracy with deliveries, I think there is a slight language barrier that makes phone in orders difficult.  However, they are quick to hurry back with the correct order.  All in all, Chen & Wok is a great deal for amazing food!
The three of us ordered Seafood noodles, Salt and pepper shrimp, Braised sea bass, Black pepper sauce mushrooms, and garlic/chinese parsley pork.
First of all, I was given a large spoon to eat my beef with broccoli. At this point, I don't feel like getting another look, so I pretend that I am accustomed to eating broccoli with a spoon and I smile and say thank you. Then I take the first bite. DISGUSTING!  It tasted like pounded beef fat covered in pure oyster sauce dipped in salt. The broccoli was a bit overcooked and every so often while hovering over my plate to prevent lap spillage, I get a whiff of some foul stank feet. No, it was not me, it was the plate. I have worked in enough short order kitchens to recognize that scent. It's filthy dish water. I was so appalled that I bothered to write this review. I would not have normally bothered to write a review of a strip mall place, but it was so gnarly that I want to prevent anyone from going to China One.
Chop Chop = Cheap Cheap
   I'd to explain my " pickiness" when it comes to Japanese food. My mother is Japanese, I'm half, born there. My husband is Japanese. 
The best Chinese on this side of town hands down. The food is pleasantly delightful. Not overly greasy nor do they put layers upon layers of batter with little to no meat like the other places. Customer service is great and they actually serve you including pouring soup into your bowl. I will continue to come here for my Chinese food fix!
The sauteed shrimp appetizer was so delicious -- my favorite!
The eggroll was fantastic though! 
I know, it's a Chinese restaurant, who cares, right? They're all supposed to be quirky and weird and use menu's constantly informing you that you were born in the year of the Ox, quite possibly the most boring animal ever.  And then you realize your birthday is in April too...So Ram + Ox = I'm a frickin Minotaur. Good. Glad everyone agrees.
I was really sad when my Beijing Zha Jiang Mein tasted really bland...My BF's Lan Zhou Beef Noodle Soup was kinda tasteless too.  The noodles have a good texture to them though. 
Or order from a large menu at the cook to order side.
Delicious!!  We ordered delivery.. arrived super hot and on time.  Delicious spring rolls, crispy and yummy.  The sweet and sour sauce that came was for the sweet and sour chicken but was SUPER good on the spring rolls.  I wish they had included extra, but that was my only "complaint".  The sweet and sour chicken came separate from its sauce which made the dish crispy like it should be.  Nicely done. The Szechuan eggplant and tofu was cooked to perfection, the shrimp chow mein was fantastic, and the Mongolian beef was perfectly spicy and fabulous.  Well worth the money!!!  We will be back!
If you don't know how to do your business, you will shut down one day, sooner or later.
Service was good enough.  Server stopped by and checked on us and don't be afraid if you don't speak chinese cuz they do! 
We also ordered the sushi roll, which was also over priced.  It wasn't fresh although it had a good flavor to it.  Service was excellent.
It just went downhill from there. We asked our waiter how big the portions were, and his reply was "a good size." Wtf. I said "this big?" (Gesturing with my hands) or "this big?" (Gesturing with my hands)... "Yeah, that big," he said. Thanks for the non-clarification. 
One day not too long ago the IT department managed to pull ourselves away from Japanese Bug Fights and Star Wars done entirely in Terminal long enough to decide that we were hungry, we wanted Chinese, and that although Jetta was in no mood to be yelled at over the phone, she was a bitch and deserved it anyway.
I find it difficult to fault the service.  We were a large group and fed efficiently, politely and treated with great courtesy.  Dishes were delivered promptly while still hot, my one small criticism is that they could have cleared the used dishes a little quicker.  However this was barely noticeable as we tucked into the next wonderful course that came our way!
The only thing that could be better is the location, but to be quite honest I would rather it be where its at with the current prices.
I haven't experienced a whole lot from their menu--mostly either Orange Chicken or General Tso's Chicken. Both of the chicken dishes, when done right, offer a really, really sweet and slightly spicy taste. The General Tso's Chicken, in particular, has red pepper flakes in the sauce which adds a really nice kick. However, it always happens where you get overcooked chicken that makes it crunchy and almost impossible to eat--and as a result, I can't justify giving Asian Kitchen 4 stars.
A good family restaurant. Authentic Hong Kong fare.  One of the places our family goes to dinner almost each and every visit from the Bay Area.
Love this place. Fast, hot and delicious. We don't usually stray far from our go-to items like orange chicken, beef and broccoli, chicken and broccoli, egg drop soup and fried wontons. Try this place, I seriously doubt you'll be disappointed.
My dinner was pretty bland but that was okay because I took what they gave me.  Surprising thing is that there was more chicken than vegetables, usually the opposite of what one might expect.  Overall there wasn't much flavor and some gristle in the chicken but it filled me up.  Overall that is the objective when one sits down to eat, isn't it?
I have been here several times for take out. I always have had a good meal. Always hot and just the way I order it. The staff is really nice. I would recommend it!
The sauce was a thick gravy that was not characteristic of any type of cuisine I have ever tasted. It was sweet and very SALTY; it kind of tasted like a blend of soy sauce, mushrooms, and milk. Once again, I can't put my finger to it, but it was gross. The beef was extremely starchy and rubbery. I tried to cover the taste up with hot sauce, but that didn't work.
The entry was quite good, though I'm not as big a fan of General Tso's style dishes (again, with a nod toward Mark B.), and the description had led me to believe I'd be getting more vegetables in it (that's a problem I have with all Chinese restaurants). Definitely worth ordering if you like that style of thing though. The salad was okay, mostly lettuce, with a sweet dressing and wonton noodles on it. The egg roll was subpar, and the crab puff was, as noted by Heather C, mostly cream cheese, little crab.
Home made egg rolls are wonderful, two would make a meal. The ingredients are fresh and the flavors great. One order can easily feed two or you can have leftovers for the next day.
-One of their house special steak dishes (I think it was Sizzling Black Pepper Beef in a dark sauce).
nice room, they have 3 or 4 television.
I ordered Steamed Fish (Sea Bass), Roast Pork with Crispy Skin, and Snow Peas Leaves, easily enough food for 3 to 4 people, the total for which came to less than $40.
The price is right! (less than $10 a person)
I would eat here again
dinner
Ahhh the Lotus. An old-Henderson must! The service is fast and friendly. They have good specials and decent food. Don't go here if you are looking for a 5 star place. Go here if you want a great casual dinning experience with greasy American-Chinese food and a sweet little Chinese waitress who will say, "Ah yes, ok, ok, dank you." It's not racist - I adore her!
Well I was in search of lunch and happened by this place from yelp. Everyone gave this place the best reviews and well although I may be raving about it this place is really good.
The reason for the 4 stars is for the milk tea! Only $1.75 and the guy kept refilling my drink! For free! The milk tea is delicious and refreshing in the hot Vegas weather.
-marinated crispy chicken with seasoned salt: OMG. So good. Well seasoned, very crispy skin and lots on the plate. A must have when you come here. The chicken is marinated for a day, at least, because the marination was down to the bone. 
SERVICE - 2 stars...why the sour face? 
-...until we realized that had forgotten multiple orders of our meal (I'm not talkin' about (1) order, more like 6 orders of dumplings, 4 orders of something else, another order of noodles...it was pretty bad
Spurred on by my friend Ryan C.'s  review, I decided to give this buffet a try today. I didn't expect much, especially since I came in at 2 PM. My first glance of the inside of the place made me immediately wonder whether I should immediately leave and eat somewhere else - after all, there's a Los Reyes de la Torta down the street - or take a chance and stay; I decided to do the latter. As you can see from the pics I posted, it's definitely not a fancy place. In fact, it's quite the opposite of a glitzy and spacious super buffet: small, cramped dining area, limited menu with some dishes that did not look very appealing, and only one soup (egg drop, natch). But whereas some super buffets have a large array of attractive-looking but often bland menu items, the food items in this place, in spite of their somewhat unappealing appearance, are fresh and good-tasting! What a surprise! My friend Ryan was right. In all, I had a really satisfying meal here and learned that sometimes you really can't judge a place (or its food) by appearances alone.
Mainly, the curry chicken tasted stale & the chicken was almost gelatin it was so soft.  I am, typically, not a waster, but I threw this dish out.  I know that chicken takes on the flavor of the sauce you cook it in, but, in this case, it took on the staleness of the curry.
fried rice...not nearly as flavorful
- Lychee Martini
The initial taste of the take out foods were OK.
I've been coming here for years.  It's always a treat to stop by Tao Garden for dinner.  The decor is that of all Chinese restaurants so don't expect to be wow'd.  
I can't figure out HOW we made such a mistake with this place, with such good reviews. First, it was expensive ($30 for takeout- a sesame chicken, a schezuan chicken, and fried rice... I was expecting a tab closer to $21-25 with tax.) 
If you're not in a position to drive to the Spring Mountain Road area, this place is fine.  I've been a regular since they opened this location a few years back.  Earlier on, their food was more consistent and tasty, especially for a suburban Chinese restaurant.  
Lambs beware! This place serves up tasty lamb in so many ways, grilled, stewed, boiled, fried you name they got it! Bad for lambs but good for us. I typically hate lamb for its gamey taste however this place does lamb right. I'm also assuming this place came from California since their website says Rosemead so I'm glad that Cali food is coming over. 
Wow! Delicious authentic and under $10 Chinese food. 
In response to one the reviews, My Chinese friends have a saying about dirty restaurants too. Nasty. The one fish tank was cloudy, the spot was greasy and the bathrooms, yuck! 
Ordered orange beef, sweet and sour chicken and the shrimp vegetable,  all were really good surprisingly.  The orange beef is probably the best I've had from a delivery, could use a lil more spiciness. 
honestly if you gave this place more than 2 stars you need to get yourself down to chinatown on spring mountain and valley view and get yourself some WONTON NOODLES @ sam woo there because mannnnn are you missing out!!!! 
Good Chinese.  If you are a whitey like me, ask for it Chinese style and you will get a much better version of what is on the menu!  Obviously, try the many homemade dumplings.
Ohhh Myyyy!!! The crab puffs are heavenly, absolutely incredible!
I can't remember what the name of the seafood dish wa.  It wa one of those dishes with a light white wine sauce and 6-7 types of seafood.  Most Chinese places have some version of this called "Happy Family" or "Ocean Delight" or "Little Mermaid Bits" or something like that.  Anyway, it wa pretty good, the seafood wa not overdone which I always appreciate.
Dont waste your money on this location. I will go to Flos on FLW and Thompson Peak any day. I love it.
I ordered the vegetable fried rice. Believe me when I say I could have made better rice with my feet.
The fried rice is more than enough reason to go back to Nee House.
This is a hot pot place with fairly quick svc once you do order the hot pot that comes in seafood, meat, or lamb (14.95).  It comes out right away & my son loves when they light the sterno.  Don't put everything at once in the pot or it won't cook/boil so decide what you are ready to eat, cool, or cook.   Don't get the fried tofu appetizer (San Pan Tofu $5.25) cuz it's deep fried & barely tolerable.   My parents like the traditional red bean drink (3.95) but I don't care for it.  The mango strawberry shake, though was very refreshing (3.95)
Best Chinese food in the area by far. Super fast, super cheap, just as it should be. Called in my order for Hunan Beef, Orange Chicken (Asked them to make it spicy), and crab poofs. Was ready in 10 min and came in at $20. Can't go wrong
Overall, I thought the food was A-OK at this family operated restaurant (Mom, and son both works here in the front, and the dad is likely in the kitchen cooking).  It is the closest Chinese dumpling restaurant to where I live for now, so I will be stopping by in the near future.  Plus I asked to see if they also can make Xiao Long Bao, given that they are calling themselves the Dumpling King and serve many of the dumpling specialties from the same region, and was told that they just added that to their menu that day.  Would have been nice to offer up such information when I was reading the menu or at the time I was placing my orders, but oh well. Just another reason to go back. Maybe later for dinner.
Lovely owner...
Some dishes that are decent: chicken with black bean sauce, chicken lo mein, and anything with chow fun. All are excellent choices.
This place is pretty good for a quick lunch special. The lunch special comes with a spring roll and soup along with your entree and choice of steamed or fried rice. 
I was originally excited about this place since it's so close to my house but they've really slacked since opening.  My last take out from there was truly awful.  I ordered the chicken chow mein and the chicken tasted rotten...I couldn't finish it.
My husband and I love this place. Delivery is fast and food arrives hot. I'm not that adventurous with Chinese food and usually stick to the basics.... General Tso Chicken, shrimp egg fu young and garlic pepper shrimp. All are delicious and reminds me of the Chinese takeout back east.
Worst. Service. Ever. Standing at the hostess stand looking at a clean empty table for 4 and girl up front refuses to seat us. She claims the server is backed up thus we cant be seated. I am a local and will not be back.
I will definitely be back to try some of their other offerings, while waiting I spied someones Lo Mein which also looked quite tasty...and the prices will be perfect for my after Christmas budget! The only downside I can see so far is the absence of Sesame Chicken on the menu....but I guess I will just be forced to try something new!
Tried this place for lunch a few weeks back based on the Yelp reviews, and SOLELY on Yelp reviews as based on principal alone I don't think I'd ever randomly walk into a place called "Food Express"   Just on a whim I could come up with at least 515,129 better names (list coming soon!), but I digress....
* Salty fish and chicken fried rice = I have no idea why we ordered this and really wasn't my choice but my friend insisted we try it.  It actually wasn't as bad as it sounds but it was in fact a bit weird for my palate.  I think I should stick to fried rice without the fish though next time.
For what it is, a fast food Americanized Oriental restaurant, it's not overly bad, as long as you don't order shrimp.
A solid lunch. They have a daily lunch special for $5.50 and all the other lunch items are $5.75. Well worth it. I will go back for sure.
-1 for mediocre service, asking for refills shouldn't be necessary when your paying this much.
The food is a bit overpriced for what you would find in LA, where competition for Chinese food is fierce, especially in the San Gabriel Valley.  But I find the prices about right for Madison.  Seriously, I rather pay 9 dollars for 10 appropriately portioned delicious, fresh, handmade dumplings than $8 for overly sweet and greasy General Tso's chicken, no matter how much of it they stuff into the styrofoam container.  
Sorry, but after coming back a few times, our experiences get worse and worse that 2 star bump down is fair. 
Their shaved ice was just chunks and bits of ice. Didn't really like the red bean on it either. This was, I guess, average/mediocre. Nothing you'd ever go craving for. Our waitress was nice and friendly though. We got checked up on and she was at refilling our waters even though we didn't need anymore, haha.
Very authentic Szechwan style restaurant.  On a average Sat evening, the restaurant is pack full of Chinese family.  The service has improved a bit recently.  The first opening months usually has very long wait.
I love this place.
Green Beans w/ Oyster Sauce
This Panda Express is located inside Vons near the produce department. I like that I can grab something to eat while getting a few items at the store. It just is convenient without having to then make another stop for food. I have to say the employees here are awesome. Well, the manager this last time was having lunch and talking with someone (maybe having a meeting?) while this girl was hustling to take care of the orders. I questioned how long something has been sitting out and she offered to make it fresh if I didn't mind waiting. Of course not! I can't believe how this girl was working so hard to take care of the customers and offering to make me fresh food while the manager laughed away in her conversation only a couple feet from me. She should have excused herself and pitched in for a moment. I took the time to tell the girl helping me that she was a hard worker and that I appreciated her service. I only wish I caught her name to give her a shout-out in this review. 
EXCEPTIONAL SOUTHERN STYLE CHINESE CUISINE
I wouldn't go back.
With the price of gas, I really appreciate the delivery option. The drivers are always nice. (I do tip them well!) You may have to wait, the weekends in Tempe are crazy, but worth it. The cooks are the real deal.
Good tofu!
This place really deserves one star, but it is salvaged by the incredible service from Mindy who hails from DC. This is the blandest, most vanilla and unappetizing Chinese I've ever had. To boot, it was INCREDIBLY expensive.  Despite the ambiance and the trendiness, avoid at all cost! 
Even though we live all the way in Maricopa (ugh...) we'll still make sure we come back. It'll probably become our go-to place for some Asian dishes.
One word: consistent . 
Cold Noodles with Hot Sesame Sauce  4.50 -Just as good the next day cold and huge portion!
Looked like any other fast food noodle joint but with a very distinct McDonalds layout to it. Now that I think about it.... WTF did I eat? I know Ed went on and on about lo mein that he's been dreaming of for the longest time. But now that I think about it, I had pan friend chow mein something or another and perhaps  more noodles prepared one way or another. Can't go wrong with noodles. I am pretty sure I ordered lack luster sio mai as well. All in all it wasn't bad since I'm sure that it probably tasted 5x as good as it was greasy. 
It's not easy to find a chinese place in Chandler.  When I decided to give iKitchen a try, I did not have my hopes up.  I have to say it wasn't bad.  I had the beef noodle soup and boba milk tea.  The milk tea was good - not overly sweet.  The bobas were chewy and not mushy.  The noodle soup was tasty, although not what I expected.  The beef stew they use is more like what is usually served with rice.  Either way, I enjoyed it.  And it was reassuring to see that the waitress and cook (whom I assume to be the owners) were both chinese.  The restaurant is a low key, taiwanese deli-like restaurant in a strip mall (like everything else in Chandler).  This is not the same chinese food as LA, but I will go back or get take out when I have a hankering for Chinese.
It's also just crazy cheap.  Appetizers run $2.21 and the entrees all top out at $7.72 with a generous selection of one-dish meals at a flat five bucks.  Hard to beat that.
Had been eating here for over a year, the food is always cook Fresh.  
A pot of hot tea came with the meal and we got two glasses of ice water without asking.  I ordered as an entree shrimp and scallops with veggies, and my wife got the beef with ginger.  We got the brown rice.
Szechuan Chicken Salad ($10.95) - Yum! The salad was tossed in front of us. The portion was huge and there was plenty to go around. I really liked the flavor of the dressing best and the fresh carrots stood out.
Not real Asian food by any means but it will fill you up if you are on a budget. 
Based on my first trip, Beijing Express is very good.  Mongolian beef and General Tso's chicken and dumplings were all better than the same offerings by other Chinese in the area.  They gave me a lunch special price on a Sunday at 3:03pm, which was very appreciated.  The portion sizes are substantial, the vegetables in the Mongolian beef were fresh and plentiful.  The location is clean, and they deliver which is awesome.  It's nothing ground breaking, but it is now my go-to Chinese place.  Keep up the good work!
I would give it 5 stars but I really like pot stickers and theirs are not so great. I ate one and threw away the rest. Their crab puffs are alright, very cute but taste wise is okay. 
My daughter gets a rather bland, Cantonese lunch and of course is unimpressed. Wife suggests that this probably isn't the place to bring my daughter who pretty much has issues with eating anything that reminds her that it once walked/flew/swam on earth.
That's what my fortune cookie said during my first meal at Sunshine Moon Peking Pub the other night.  I say "first meal" because I  know there will be more... (and hopefully better fortunes than that one too!)
Great Food ? just access was slightly challenging due to construction going on there, good people 
It's almost cliche to order pork chow mein when you go out to Chinese food, but here it's worth it.  I'll revisit them when I'm more hungry and try some other things!
If you lose all your cash on the slots, come here and eat cheap. I think it was like $8.00 pp.
First, they advertised on Xiao Lung Bao for $2.95 and we got charged for $6.95. I confronted the waiter, He said he already gave me $2 off. It was supposed to be $8.95.
Really good food! The calamari was outstanding (it's white meat only served in fillets, not rings...seasoned perfectly). Their happy hour is the best time to go...cheap appetizers that are delicious. Drinks were strong. The service was a little slow. But the food is just amazing. I've been three times now, ordered something different each time, and loved it!
On a hot afternoon, taking a stop inside to eat one of those crepes or ice cream mango sundae would make me cool off! I'd go back just to do those.
The cashier asked me if I'd like some soup while I waited and I declined, but it's a gesture worth noting. 
Our first dish, Mu Shu Vegetables were great, so we remained hopeful for our main dishes.  Then, our hopes were dashed.
If I had written this review when I initially started going to Dragon Wok about 6 years ago, this might have been 4-stars. At the time, I was really happy there was a decent Chinese place for quick eats and pick-up close-by.
Wonderful service and delicious food. Curry Beef is great with just the right amount of spice. Crab Rangoon is a great starter. Try the pork fried rice. It's great, I promise. I will keep going back to Chop Chop Wok in the future. Probably next week
They also serve Thai cuisine. I've had some of their curries, and although they are good, they're not the greatest Thai curries I've had. However, that being said, my rating for Joyful still stays at a four star, because it is a Chinese eatery, not a Thai joint. 
Worst Chinese food ever!   Waited over 90 min for delivery to hotel then absolutely nothing tasted like it should have.   Kung pao chickens only vegetable was 2 pieces of broccoli, and it tasted like sweet &  sour chicken.  Would never recommend!
Last time the food was excellent. This time it is dry and lukewarm.  The service staff is worse than the food. All they want is your money and then they dont help you after you place an order in togo. My food was sitting at the counter for 7 minutes while the staff just stare at you in aw. Not a smile in site from 6 employees. With that said, it felt unwelcoming, almost to the point where you are bothering the employees. And the kid that took my order was very effortless that had no energy to lift his fingers to help out. I was the only one in the restaurant at the time. I give this place one more chance before I stop coming here.
I recommend the ASU Devil Chicken... Their stir fried veggies are good too. I have not had anything that was not good. Their crab puffs are really good. A bit on the sweet side but I am not complaining.
Golden China is on the opposite corner of 107th & Indian School as Dragon Garden Express and a block west of Wong's. This explains why I never tried it all these years. I just saw it at superfluous.
Here's a general tip for you guys: if the place isn't predominantly Asian, leave. That's a definite sign that the quality is sub-par. But if you're white and have never had genuine southern Chinese food, you'll probably just barely choke down your "food" and agree with most people that this place is decent.
Great selection of food, tasty and pretty cheap too!
I took the family here for a late bit before heading home. The service is perfect, the place is clean, the food is good, the $ is great. 
For hot pot in Vegas I only come to this place. The soup base is very flavorful, made with Chinese herbs. Could ask for different spicy levels. Good place to eat with friends in a cold winter night !
- Quail appetizer
Authentic chinese cooking. Family run place.
I heart the King Wah! 
Both the dishes we ordered were fine - pepper shrimp and sweet and sour chicken - but not great.  The portions were more than adequate and the ingredients were better than average (larger shrimp, good white meat chicken).  But the flavors were yesterday, the service was maybe a bit too casual, and the restaurant was far too loud, especially when the bar was full of people.
GREAT Chinese food ，spicy，i like spicy food , spicy crisp chicken ,spicy string bean,\eggplant with spicy gralic sauce,thin wrap pork in sauce , sichuan style cucumber,its awesome，
 Would recommend. Want to go back on a Sunday when the cook is back to try the dim sum.
Tott's does not disappoint.  The menu is actually pretty similar to Pei Wei with one outstanding factor, the owner of this place came out and talked to us, him and his family own and run it.  They've been there for six years now he says (2 before Pei Wei).  Pretty messed up that the property owner would put a second Asian diner in there.  Pretty messed up that Pei Wei would try to exploit a mom and pop shop's built up following.
Not much to complain about - Wok and Wine is getting 5 stars. Maybe more chilli sauce as only a little dish provided. Chances are, they would have given me more, if I had stopped eating long enough to ask but this was just a minor thing for this GF girl...
Beef stew noodle soup: the meat in here is wonderfully tender and the soup is fantastic.
1.  Seafood Tofu Hot Pot - This was small sizzling clay pot full of goodies.  Though a small complaint on the ratio of tofu being more than the seafood, the components were all tasty.  Crispy nuggets of tofu, nice tasty bites of fish, bamboo, squid sizzling in a smooth brown sauce.
This place is soooo YUMMMY!! I always order my delivery and the come on time! :) And they always pack the togo boxes to the max! So I always have left overs everytime. And its so cheap here! Its hard to find quality food for good prices! Oh and their  boba is freakin delicious!!!! All in All this place is wonderful!!
Customer Service (5 stars)
Good stuff.  Dishes I remember my grandmother making.  But nothing that compared to her recipes
I first tried Great Wall with a couple of friends of mine: one of whom had never really had Chinese food and one who was already a big fan of their food.
Weekday dinner, party of 2
However - little known secret - if you want AUTHENTIC chinese food (less sauce/sugar and no MSG) they will make it for you.  But, if you like the PF Changs style cooking (which I admit at times I do too!) - this place is comprable and at half the price and no wait!
I'm not sure why this place only has 3 stars?!?!
Yesterday was my second time there
Anyway, good dinner. We'll try one more time to see if this is 4 stars or 2 stars :)
Spicy Lamb Hot Pot - 5/5. This was the best part of the meal!!!! I almost wish we did more hotpot and less of the other things. The soup base was really good (they throw in lots of traditional chinese herbs (five-spice, goji beans to name a couple), and red chili peppers. And they were fairly generous with the napa cabbage, fish balls, rice noodles, and everything else you eventually threw in to the pot.
Solid, above average, chinese food.  Great friendly service.  We come here often for take out (sure wish they had delivery).  A treat in Queen Creek to have above average food at a restaraunt.
I'm no Chinese connoisseur but I really enjoy the food and it's always chock full of fresh ingredients which is huge for take out. The owners are super sweet and the little girl will always talk to me. Very respectful and thankful for service. We were sad to move away from them.
So memy girlfriend and I came to this place because we heard about their Thai tea float drink. The drink was AMAZING, it had just the right amount if sweetness mixed together with the ice cream. 
A dessert of Cocanut Milk Jello, a dessert I've never seen at any other Chinese restaurant, comes with your meal...  FREE!
Located inside a very seedy and rather run down strip mall on one of the roughest intersections in the city, Happy food has not changed ONE bit since I was a kid, the same tables, the same wallpaper, the same bossy and quick talking cashier. But what has changed is the arcade games they have on one side of the resturant. 
Delivery time was accurate... so that I can't complain about.  But I will say, I'm pretty sure they ran over my food before dropping it off.  My sauce that I ordered on the side was tipped over and on the verge of spilling.  I ordered food for my boyfriend as well, and his was overflowing with grease, and the grease lined the inside of the bag and made its way into my box of food as well - which I purposely had steamed to try to be a little more healthy.  My box was cracked, and pieces of chicken were starting to fall out into the plastic bag.
When we sat down my sister and brother-in-law and I compared our must haves: i need extra vegetables, they needed the aromatic crispy duck with pancakes (Peking duck) and hot and sour soup, we agreed on fried rice and bean curd and black bean sauce. It was all so good. The duck especially was a much larger serving than I am used to and we could make our own pancakes. The fried rice tasted just like home.
Eaten here 50 or more times.
Good neighborhood Chinese restaurant!
This restaurant gets 5 stars from me and my family for its delicious food, the ease and quality of delivery, and most of all for the pleasant staff! Despite confusion with getting to my house (entirely my bad! So sorry!) the man was completely kind and my food still fresh. Thanks for the great service!
Bill was $21 and we brought half home. Not too shabby! 
3. Wazuzu (OVERPRICE ALERT!)
After we finished our meal, we stood outside and watched the old chef making hand-pulled noodle, and watched his assistant making the knife-shredded noodle. The old chef did make the hand-pulled noodle very nicely. Nice hands and skills. We also saw another assistant chef making dumpling further inside the kitchen. We were happy with what we ate and with the experience. (we went by the previous night and watched a younger chef making hand-pulled noodle; I think the older chef's skills was way better than the younger chef, which makes sense as the older chef has more experience than the younger chef does)
we were worried at first abt the timing of when we'd receive the delivery cuz eat24 claimed it could be up to 150 mins, but instead it was more like 30ish mins thankfully lol.. we were starving that nite, and the FP's chinese food hit the spot :) 
Older reviews you read here are for the previous owners. Current owners, Lavinia and her husband serve quality food and have recently introduced Peking Ribs which are racks of St. Louis ribs that are simply fall off the bone to die for! The sauce is not your traditional smoky BBQ (remember this is a Chinese restaurant, people!), but a more subtle savory sweetness true to the desired yin-yang of Asian cooking. We sampled a small serving tonight but will certainly be back for more another time!
They actually have a much higher rating on Urbanspoon(US) of 81% which has 4 reviews, 3 of them were recent from 2011. I found them on google maps looking for "chinese". I was able to see the menu clearly and decided to give them a try.
Try the Shanghai dumplings, lettuce wrap,  Chilean seabass, tofu with eggplant,  Hakka noodles, asparagus, and macarons!  Delish!  Server's and bartenders know their stuff here and it has an awesome romantic vibe.
Also thought the take out food situation was weird, they give you a Styrofoam clam shell thing, you fill it yourself with whatever and then you pay something like $3.65 a pound for your order. WTF, is with that? I'll pass on that. 
Our order - starter selection, prawn Pad Thai, chicken Pad Thai, chicken Green Curry, rice and garlic noodles - came to just over £40, so really very reasonable.
Seeing the owners hand rolling dumpling wrappers and making dumplings was very DTFish.
If you're in search of an amazing Chinese restaurant, look no further! I was very pleased with my experience at Chen's Chinese Bistro. 
If I want Chinese, I go to Chinese. If I want American , I go to eat American food. If I want African, same. I just don't get it. You might be able to fool some people , but eventually , the causes you are making will catch with you. I didn't even want to give this place an one star. Just as bad as the Edo down the street. Why people? Do you keep on getting fooled , if you pay cheap, you get what you pay for.
Good comfort food. 3.5 stars but rounded up. It's cheap and what you expect it to be. Had the juicy dumplings which had soup in it and quite tasty. Also liked the suikaow noodle soup. Lots to choose from so try it all. The crab vermicelli wasn't anything special. Don't order it. Will try curry next time. The dessert was the fresh fruit filo crust thing. Not really fresh fruit other than the mangos. Was ok, would probably go somewhere else for dessert. If you don't expect much (this is not meant for full family sit-down meals), and treat it like a lunch or late night cafe spot, you'll be satisfied.
Absolutely make sure you CHECK UR BILL!!! I would never come back thats for sure. Red 8 my ass you should call urself one done!!!
Only good handmade food that pleasures the palate, inteligence and pocketbook.
* Pork Spare Ribs in Black Bean Sauce ($1.80)
Most people get this restaurant confused with Beijing Noodle no 9 in Caesar's palace, which is an over salted atrocity of an excuse for Chinese food.  Although the quality of ingredients may be a bit better over there, one cannot argue the value comparison to Beijing Noodle Cafe.  All of the dishes that we ordered came under $20. That is nearly the same price as the fried rice at Caesar's.  I am a firm believer that when it comes to comfort Chinese food, moderation belies value which is what most great Chinese places are about.  After all, is there really a difference in a $120 beef noodle soup made from Kobe beef? That is something I shall never know.
The fact that they deliver is icing on the cake. The only downside is that they're close enough to my house that I feel stupid lazy if I don't go and pick it up myself.
A pot of hot tea is on the table as soon as you get sitted (+1 for that!)
The Spicy Fried Rice (extra spicy please) is an awesome side dish.  
Great service. 
Great chinese, though!
I grabbed dinner here with a friend, and it was great.
They deliver!!!  We live in Sun Lakes and have used them many times!  Great food and fast delivery!
I had the shrimp I'm lobster sauce and it was delicious! I wish there were more shrimps and less green peppers though. Also the egg flower soup was good but it was spicy. I'm not used to egg flower soup being spicy. I also ordered the crab puffs and those were divine! Especially with the sweet orange sauce!
Excellent dinner tonight!
That all being said, it wouldent take much for another chinese resturant to come along and dethrone Red Dragon....because while it isent bad....its not amazing either.
I'm surprised this place got such low reviews. After meeting up with Susan 1 and mom at McCarren, we headed off to the strip and quickly settled on Dragon Noodle for dinner after grabbing a quick drink at the bar. We were greeted and seated right away. Excited for the night to start, we wasted no time picking out the goodies we wanted to nosh on. 
The service is great, my water is never empty and the servers don't bug you but they're always around if you need anything.
Wifey and I went for lunch yesterday.  I took her shopping in prep for our out of town trip this coming weekend and we got hungry.  So we decided to go and eat here again.  I ordered a whole roast duck in a take out container and also two pounds of roast pork.  For our sit-down orders, my wife ordered her wor wun tun soup and I ordered Chinese beef stew lo mein.  My wife always orders her wor wun tun soup if she feels like eating something soupy, since it is always pretty good and consistent.  I like Chinese beef stew (naunam) over noodles and this dish was pretty good too.  We also ate a little roast pork and some roast duck out of the take out containers but took most of the duck and pork home.  Why did I order so much duck and roast pork? -- Because my two dogs love this stuff.  I hand strip the meat off the duck bones and they gobble down the duck and roast pork for their dinner.  They must have eaten at least $20+ for their dinner last night.  Then they had vanilla and strawberry ice cream with strawberry syrup for their dessert, while I was watching the Dbacks game.
The service is excellent and fast. They are so welcoming and homie. I love this place! The food is fresh and tasty. You can tell the quality of the food. The servings are,also, huge enough for two people or a lot of leftovers. And I got free egg rolls. Definitely coming back.
I've been a regular at Chen Wok for over a year now. I've patiently sat on the sidelines and read some of the more negative reviews here on Yelp. And I finally couldn't hold my tongue any longer.
We had a good, though pricey, brunch buffet here.  We were actually looking for the big Bellagio buffet but we passed Jasmine first and decided we were too hungry to continue our search.  The variety here probably wasn't as big as the other buffet, but they had a lot of quality stuff including:
Based on that and that alone, I can say that Red 8 is the best money for your dollar at the Wynn.
Went there today for lunch after reading everyone's reviews of the dumplings.  I've had plenty in my lifetime and my mom is very picky about her won-tons and dumplings so I had to try it!
Anyone that has eaten here and say it is good has never had real chinese food. Coming from the east coast and having a local chain that everything was made on premises may have spoiled me but holy smokes this place is bad. Suace turning into jelly as you sit there. powdered mix packets add water heat and stir sauce will thicken upon standing. You can buy those at albertsons.
  Then, they served me the soup of the day: egg drop soup. This has been the soup of the day at China Go Go everyday for the last three years. My taste buds would enjoy something different, such as won ton or hot and sour soup.
The wonderful ambiance and service invites you to slow down and enjoy every bite at this restaurant. 
    
I came into HK Star with my roommate today and had a great lunch.  They had many choices for the lunch special based on price.  One section was 4.95, the other was 5.95, and the most expensive was 6.95.  While many lunch specials come with salad, soup, egg roll, and maybe some other items, HK star's lunch special came with only the entree and a side of rice.  This was no problem, though, because the portion of the entree was very large.  
The service is Fantastic!
Yesterday, I brought my roommate in for dinner. Again! his meal came out first, and mine was late! Only 5 minutes this time.. but still. Neither of our meals were anything special. I had the roasted duck. Menu say half duck.. I got part of a thigh, and more bones than meat on my plate. My buddy got a seared lamb dish which he said just did not taste good. Step Your Game Up Tao Garden.. I will be back to check on you for lunch someday-
For starters, the Crispy fried beef roll and enoki mushrooms and the simple salt and pepper tempura ice fish are delicious.  Both so perfectly cooked, crispy on the outside and moist inside.
Extra points:  that this used to be Capriotti's - and now they're turning out authentic Chinese near campus...I just pray they stay true to their convictions...   
Food: Very good chinese-american cuisine, plus a couple Vietnamese and thai dishes. The sauces tasted "made from scratch", not from a can. The vegetables were plentiful and fresh.  The prices amazing for the quality.
We come here a lot when we want Chinese and cringe at the idea of Panda Express but don't want to drive to the buffet on Eastern. It is very comfortable and quiet. We go in the late afternoon and it is usually empty then. 
pork stir-fried rice noodle- too salty
If you are looking for a bit more selection and competitive price, go here rather than Panda Express.  But that is just about it.  We may see you again, because my in-laws live near you and they do like you.
TIP #1 Breakfast Buffet at a mediocre Chinese Restaurant
Never again.
If you like REALLY hot mustard (Pot Stickers & Egg Rolls demand hot mustard), ask for the "House Mustard" not the mustard packets. Yum!!
I'd happily suffer the jiggliest ass in creation all through the upcoming bikini season for one bite of their Almond Lemon Chicken. It is that good. Located in the MGM, this is simply my favorite restaurant anywhere in the country and it is far past time to review it.
But if you grew up in Seattle, SF, LA or NYC you'll def appreciate The Prime. Its not as good as those places but its the best damn Chinese food Ive had in Arizona and Im wiling to pay for good food.
Do NOT come here if you're looking for hokey and badly flavored "beef and broccoli"  BS. Go to Crazy Buffet for that crap. You go to Miu's if you want bold in your face flavors with authentic spices and organic vegetables. You go to Miu's if you want a religious experience in your mouth.
 if i lazy for make dimsum , i and hubby dimsum this place.
My daughter and I went on Chinese New Year for the first time and were very pleased.  The decor is nice, modern and spacious.  My only complaint was that the TV was on and set to Food channel. We arrived at 3:15 or so and the lunch menu was served - amazing value!  All the lunch meals come with soup and we both had hot & sour.  Very good.   My daughter also got the appetizer Shangri-la chicken salad and it was good, sweet and tangy dressing over lettuce and shredded chicken.  My daughter got the kung pao shrimp and chicken and I got the crystal shrimp.  The shrimp in both entrees was very good, plump and big, cooked really well.  The crystal shrimp had a bit too much sauce, but was tasty and had plenty of veggies.  The meals also came with egg rolls, white rice and a crab puff.  I am not a fan of crab puffs, but my daughter said they were good.  So much food, we had the egg rolls for dinner and they were amazing!  Highly recommended!
So if you're in the hood, (a.k.a. UNLV) lookin for somethin good, try China Joe's.
I love cheap Chinese food, however, New Golden China seems to take the "cheap" concept a bit too far... 
The service this evening was a tad on the slow side. Not a big deal, they were understandably very busy on this weekend night and quite popular. A bunch of us showed up at the same time to be seated. The booths are comfortable and seating near the front window allowed for pleasant conversation as noise levels in the middle of the dining area seemed quite loud.
I went here from work to eat lunch. As you walk inside you can see all the tanks with lobster and crab and different kinds of fish on the menu. I wanted to get chow me in instead of rice and they wouldn't su substitute even for an additional fee I had to order an entire order of noodles if I wanted them. They waiter was rude and seemed to steer clear of us the whole time. The food was only decent. For their outrageous prices for such mediocre food, I'll probably not return.
Salt and pepper pork chops - one of the better ones in Vegas
The bao was also really good. The dough was some of the best I have had...as someone who has never been to China. The filling didn't quite seem to fill the cavity but it tasted great. Real standard but delicious.  
Tip for Yelpers:
When we came home our food was nice and hot.  Each take out box was filled to the brim and our family of five were completely satisfied.
I have eaten at many Chinese and Asian restaurants in town and this location is at the bottom of my rankings. 
 
Started with the Pan Fried Dumplings with dipping sauce. The plate was gigantic and could be a meal just by itself. Order the Seafood Noodle Soup with one of the larger flat noodles. Both dishes were delightful and I really enjoyed getting to doctor them up with their homemade hot sauce.
I did really want to like this place, but sadly it was not meant to be. We took most of our food to go (as I hate wasting food), but ended up throwing it out for fear of encountering it again.
Stopped by for a lunch thanks to fellow yelpers :)
Mostly veggie friendly, (already mentioned) affordable for Vegas (or anywhere +1 star).
A friend of mine told me this place recently opened and when we pulled into the plaza, they only had a cloth banner mentioning of a grand opening.
Much for it.  The sauce just didn't taste right.  It was bitter I thought. 
We usually get take out, for dinner, but if you go for lunch, the prices are good, and you get soup and I think a crab puff. So, if you're looking for a good deal, definitely go for lunch. 
I walked by on my way to Food Town, and I picked up a menu.  In  perusing the offerings, I was struck by the Thai Basil Chicken combination. I figured with egg roll and Lo Mein, the combination would probably work.  After picking up the Food Town items, I walked toward Gourmet Wok.
THIS is one of my favorite regular places.  And yes, they greet me with friendly recognition, after I came a few times.   
The dishes I like are:
And, as an added bonus, I did confirm the fact that Abacus Chinese Restaurant does have an actual abacus on site. It's up front by the register. Check it out!
Will be part of a regular rotation at lunch. Excited to go back and try something else!
I don't care if it's authentic or not, what's important to me is how good is it.  It is so good I find it hard to eat Chinese food anywhere else.
Another in a seemingly endless series of completely shitty, cookie-cuter Chinese restaurants.  The food at this place makes Panda Garden look like a *REAL* Chinese restaurant.  The "potstickers" are really "deep fryer" stickers and are so glutenous you could use them to plug holes in your boat.  There is nothing even remotely authentic or even edible in this armpit.
 The staff are the only reason why I am not giving Chop Chop 1 star, they were great. Very friendly and helpful.
Service was good, food was horrible. Nothing had flavor, food was cold, tasteless and gross. We had to run through McDonald's to get my wife something and that was better than good china.  Would not recommend it
My favorite place to eat in Vegas!  When you're dehydrated, hungover and exhausted and probably hungry b/c you haven't had a square meal all weekend, Noodle Asia is the perfect place to go!  A meal here works wonders!  I love their shrimp fried rice and schechwan beef noodle soup (add some white vinegar)!
Come here all the time. Make sure you ask to taste before you buy. Sometimes it can be a bit dry bc food has been sitting there for some time.
This place was a disappointment. I was totally looking forward to getting some Chinese food the day I ate here. I did a delivery order, and the person who took my order was so very rude. Our food did arrive hot but I don't know about fresh. The food was so bad I didn't even finish it.
I've seen people comment before on their health department reviews, which like any restaurant has had their share of infractions.  And don't believe just because the health dept. hasn't found them doesn't mean they exist if you think your favorite restaurant is squeaky clean.  I'm the kind of person that doesn't obsess about sanitation especially when facing a great meal of street tacos, take out chinese, or whatever. 
The rice was obviously old and not reheated enough to even be warm. Utensils have that film over it that stays when not properly scrubbed. I was handed a set of chopsticks with just one stick.  People just walk up to the counter and grab their own boxes, forks, crab crackers etc.  
Creativity/Authenticity: 3
Whenever I'm home in Vegas, my family always gets together at KJ Kitchen. The fare can get pretty heavy/rich so keep that in mind. 
Awesome food! I always get the sesame chicken! It's my favorite. This place has a really nice atmosphere and the owner is very nice as well
Just moved to the area and this place delivers- had the pineapple chicken, sesame chicken, shrimp fried rice & wonton soup. All was delicious! Pineapple chicken had a hint of spice to it and was fantastic. Sesame chicken had a honey type sauce. Like I said all good!
 Your orders in. 10 minutes later its ready. You walk in and the hostess remembers your name (+.5) 
I also really liked grabbing the fortune cookies before we sat down and we opened them up while waiting for the food, and like naughty children got to get another one when leaving. I had a huge take-out container and I kept thinking about that huge white container sitting in my breakroom fridge. If I was a cartoon character, it would be a series of panels doing a variety of activities while a big fluffy thought balloon of Tott's yellow curry.
At our later visit my dad had their curry beef? i dont know how it was but i assumed it was good since my dad finished it. we also had the beef chow fun, it was very good, a lot of flavor from the "fire" from the stove.
We have been visiting this place once or twice a week and we are still loving it.  I just added sesame chicken to the rotation and it is also amazing.  We love this place.
This was the worst food i ever had. They messed up our order when they delivered it. So we had to call and I brought the rest of the food. My daughter got sick a few hours  later and I believe she got food poisoning. So my review on this is do not eat here
For years we been getting take out/delivery from china one but after finding china tango this will be our new place from now on.  Food arrived fast, hot and most importantly was good!  China One VERY Salty food!
By far one of the best. The plates are huge and the service was fast. I will be going back. Hopefully soon!
I hope you and others try it and find it to your liking because I want everyone to succeed
So I came here over the weekend looking for some Taiwanese breakfast and figured Chinatown must have it.  Got to Chinatown, saw "YongHe" outside which means Taiwanese breakfast so I was pretty excited when I went in.  
Now for the good stuff:
ALSO, if you happen to stay in the hotel, use the $20 discount coupon from the book they give you! They let us use all 4 and got $80 off the check!!!
The location is a bit unfortunate, as I think this place would have a lot more business elsewhere.  The service and the food are definitely worth checking this place out.
The reason I would come back here :
Kinda pricey for the portions.  But the assorted BBQ platter was rocking ($28). Everyone around was drinking water (Drinks cost $12-$20).
They can sure improve the ambiance in this place. Dim lighting combined with a run down look makes this place very unappealing. The booths were uncomfortable and the large fish tank at the front of the restaurant looks very dirty. I question if those gold fishes are happy in that tank. It's a very shabby, hole in the wall type feel. 
the chow main with beef, chicken, and shrimp was decent. the large pieces of beef, chicken, and whole shrimp were generous.
BBQ short rib w rice/pasta - $7.50
In the end, the dumplings and the green onion pancake was just okay to me. But the beef noodle soup was surprisingly not too shabby :0D. They also have boba drinks but we didn't end up trying any.
So the only reason why I gave the three stars is because overall the food was decent.  I've had WAY worse Chinese food.  I'm hoping all the chaos was due to a new opening.
I love the property (the Downtown Grand) and what they seem to be trying to do with Pizza Rock and Triple George (both excellent) but this really missed the mark.
But not for me,
What really stood out was their fried rice. I don't normally order pork fried rice, but my dad ordered some for the table and the flavor was phenomenal. The flavor was awesome, much more so than most Chinese restaurants in the area, whose fried rice tastes like white rice.
The 4 of us had plenty to eat and got out of there for $60 total.  Not too bad.
I have been eating here for years, just havent had time for a review. First off I L O V E that they have a drive thru, it makes it easy for me to call in an order and pick up during my busy lunch hour. Lunch specials are great and you get alot of food for your money. I usually get the chicken chow mein or the orange chicken. both are delicious. The egg rolls and wontons are tasty as well,  sometimes I get dissapointed with bad eggrolls, not this place :) Fried rice is great and they give you wonton chips with your meal as well. I have no complaints thats why I have been going here since 2007 and will continue to go.
#9 - The sweet burn on my tongue after eating a mouthful of Kung Pao Chicken
The food is really, really good here. My favorites are the crispy honey chicken, the sesame chicken, the egg drop soup, orange chicken, Mongolian beef, and numerous other dishes now that I think about it!
We had the sweet and sour pork on rice. Pork was cooked perfectly but the sauce could have been more sour in my opinion. We also had the spicy and sour noodle soup which was delicious--my husband couldn't stop eating it! I would eat here again.
Ok, enough reminiscing. Food- you should get the hot bean curd. It's listed in the vegetarian section, which is a total lie because it involves a lot of pork. But man it is tasty, and spicy! Tofu magic! The mushu vegetable wraps with plum sauce are also delicious and a waiter will come to your table and make them for you, which is fun to watch. Also, the free tea is awesome! It just adds to the whole experience. 
Me 10 years ago: Panda Express, mmm good, and they give you lots!
I also love the fact that they are open late, at least from what I remember! Until 2am, I believe.
But the quality? Definitely not authentic-tasting and lacked flavor. You can always add soy sauce to make it more satisfying. I think the food came off the grill a little TOO soon, almost like the chefs rush through all of their orders and don't have time to season the dishes more carefully.
couldnt wait to come back after new years
I ordered dinner from here last night.  I am a vegetarian and allergic to onions, so to say I am picky is an understatement.  The gal that answered the phone was both knowledgeable and accommodating to my specific diet.  I ordered the beef with broccoli (sub tofu) and it was amazing!  The egg rolls are also a must.  I am definitely going back!!
Wangs has been here a long time.  The food is not like the best NY Chinese you may have had, but it's not bad either.  God when you have the craving fpr General Tso chicken.
My favorite dish is the Golden Wok Chicken - so crispy and garlicky... delicious!
Previously on Fat Dumpling...
We've been here several times since it is right down the street from where the husband and I work. We've also brought the in-laws here, since they really like Pei Wei. I would have to say that this place is similar to Pei Wei, but with way more varieties and less of a "chain" feel. 
Highly recommend this if you want to grab a quick bite. 
Prices are on the higher side, but I can live with it because the food is unique, tastes great and the quality is high. Whenever I'm visiting Las Vegas, I ALWAYS go to Amlee at least once.
I went to Wokee Express tonight, per my friend's suggestion. If I'm craving Chinese food, I typically go to Taste Of China. However, I wanted to try something different, so I asked around, and was directed to Wokee Express.
Amazing martinis
I've been coming here since the month that it has opened and never had a bad experience.  The only thing I have seen change throughout time is the people on the counter.  Other than that, food and service has been consistent.
The staff was super nice. I was offered tea or water by two different people as I waited for my order. The place is clean and has a big lcd playing chinese karaoke. 
The sign at the arch under which you enter says, please wait to be seated. We did and when seated it seemed as though we were dumb for waiting. This sign I assume means nothing since all who came after waited until the wait person waved them on and said sit anywhere. 
Veggie Eggrolls were filled with cabbage only and the cabbage was not even soft/cooked inside so it was a weird texture.
Overall, except for the long wait, we found Nee house to be really good.  My dad brought home a menu for us to look at, and it has one of the most expansive menus I have ever seen at a Chinese restaurant, including a lot of seafood dishes.  My dad was happy to have gotten his fried rice fix...and I have a feeling he will be going back again soon.
Overall a great meal and worth the price ticket, for sure.  I'm glad that I found this place because of you, readers!  If you haven't tried it, please do.  It is authentic and a great place for foodies to try exotic foods.  For a restaurant to bring me a dish that transports me back to my childhood back on Guam is a great find, and this restaurant did it with their sharks fin soup.
Me and my wife come here for the food. The service is lack luster but majority of the time we get takeout anyway. About 90 ℅ of the time it's usually take out.
- The peking duck is delicious, and authentically prepared. 
I have been here a couple of times but I never reviewd it...it is good Chinese!  It is located on 3rd st just south of indian school rd.  It is a huge restaurant...in fact I do not think I have ever been in an authentic Chinese restaurant that is that large in my life...lol...there is plenty of parking on the side and back of the property.  You walk  in you are greeted by the hostess and they will take you to one of the many many tables...this place is always busy because it is very popular.  The servers are on it...they are used to getting people in and out fast because as soon as you sit down they are asking what you would like...didnt bother me because I like to get my food!  hahaha...they have great lunch specials for no more then seven to ten dollars...i like the kung pao shrimp...lots of veggies and the spice is pretty good...the house chicken is good and I enjoyed the mongolian beef when I had it too!  Once you order your food you will get it in like 5 minutes.  It is good food!  I enjoy it and I will be back!
Definitely come back to dine in and take out.
I've been to this place a few times now.  The front of the house looks a little weird because they don't have a counter; just tables to eat at.  They take your money into the kitchen and come out with your change.  The staff are very friendly.  The only things I've ever ordered are the chow mein, fried rice, and egg rolls.  The menu is more of a traditional style Hong Kong menu.  Some of the items on the menu are not found in your typical Chinese food restaurant in America.  The few entrees I was comfortable ordering were delicious.  The rice was great, the chow mein was a little on the veggie side for my liking but still tasty, and the cream of the crop; the egg rolls.  These things are awesome!  They are the best egg rolls I've ever had.  They make these from scratch, which is why they take a while.  The only thing is that they only sell them in 4s for $6, so you should be ordering for a family or you better be hungry.  Sometimes I just order the egg rolls and make a meal out of them because there's four of them and these egg rolls don't reheat well.  If they sit for a while, they get soggy from the juice of the meats inside of them so you best eat them while they're hot.  Sadly no combos, more of a "take a few people with you and split the bill" type of place.  And another thing, "CASH ONLY".  Yeah, it kinda stinks, but some of the better places to eat are also cash only; one in particular is a seafood place that starts with the letter p!
Onto the food....
Friendly service. Food was great, and they delivered quick. Great place.
Small portions, high price, slow service...
Are any of these true? Who knows. What I do know is the food is incredible and unique.
This place is fantastic.  It has far and away the best sesame chicken I've ever had.  The last time I visited Madison, this was the first place I went after leaving the airport and the last place I visited before flying out.
Dry crispy beef (Mmm this really is as described, tossed with dried peppers and sliced green peppers that I ate a couple of before realizing they were jalapeños...they are hardcore on the heat)
This place is good after a hangover! Man did the hot soup hit the spot!
1. Ordered food around 9pm on Friday night, they said it would be ready for pick up in 10 minutes! Talk about quick service! Very impressed with that.
We had....House soup, Lobster Green Onion Ginger dish, Salt & Pepper Pork & Prawns. Eggplant Clay pot, Deep-fried Flounder (filleted and presented brilliantly) Beef Noodle w/beef, Peas Sprouts and white rice....
Not sure what has changed in the past month (the menu that came with my last order said "under new ownership") but the delivery service has gone WAY downhill. 
well what do you have to lose when youre trying new eateries, just money right? well, worse case scenario, not coming back. am I not right?
The employees were very friendly up until the time we walked out the door.  We wouldn't mind stopping by Yan's again to try some new dishes, but for sure I would order the Twice cooked beef again!
Mix Mix Beef Tendon plate
So glad to have found this place hidden in a dive of a strip mall (aren't all  places in strip malls in Phx?). Hey, it allowed me to finally find Joe's Grotto too.
Hole in the wall? Yup. Spectacularly good food? You betcha! You know you're in for a good meal when you're one of like 8 white folks in an absolutely packed restaurant full to the brim with Asian folks! Young and old alike! Chicken with black bean sauce was delicious and the chili salt chicken wings were crispy and tasty and only $2 and change for 5 wings! Pretty good service, too. The lady who sat me and took my order was very nice and the young man attending the tables was personable and friendly and spoke very good English. I will absolutely be back!
traditional chines take out joint.  how can you really mess up americanized chinese food?  kinda greasy noodles and it tastes good actually-- but that could be my hung-over taste buds talking here.
The Food
The taste is good for the first few bites, and then it all is just repetitive. Almost like an overly syrup-ed food that just coats your tongue and you don't taste anything else but sweet....until you bite down on a chili or a jalapeno. It didn't really seem balanced to me.
Whenever my extended family stays at the Wynn (more than I'd like to admit...), we always enjoy a meal at Red 8. The Asian food here is really yummy and it's fun to look out the "window" into the Wynn casino.
Absolutely horrid!! We ordered here because of a flier on our door and they deliver. The main dishes were ok, it's hard to mess up sweet and sour and teriyaki. The fried rice was the worst I've ever had, I can't believe they even choose to send this out. The crab puffs were hard and soggy at the same time and the filling was just Philadelphia cream cheese alone. The eggs rolls had a tolerable texture but were almost bitter in taste. After waiting for over an hour for delivery this meal was terribly disappointing! We will never order here again!!
Me (in my head, not out loud): "This sounds like the perfect opportunity to use the Yelp app!" 
Firstly, the food was terrible, we ordered eight items and not one of them was good. The food was simply tasteless.
The Peeking Dumplings were wilted and flavorless.  The sauce that went with them could not revive them.  The Chinese mustard was in little packets and had no heat...Viagra needed:(!
This is resturant was such a great find when I was living near Arrowhead.  My children love their food.  The service is fast and the servers are always friendly.  They have amazing crab puffs and my faving is Sun Devil Chicken.  Yummy!  You won't go home hungry.  I have always eat my left overs for lunch the next day!!
I've passed by that place at night occasionally and I always see it full. Now I know why.
Lady had the Hong Kong noodles.  Wide noodles with cabbage and bok choy.  Wonderful flavor here, kind of a grill taste.  My choice was Udon noodles with beef as well.  Noodles were very soft and the fermented beans that made the sauce for mine were very flavorful.  Neither dish was particularly spicy, but both had great flavor.  Definitely better than any fast Chinese I have had in the valley.
The only downside about this place (which doesn't bother me anyways) is that it doesn't offer any fountain sodas, just cans.  So if you get pissy about any of that, don't bother going.  They have what I call "exotic" drinks though like Boba with Milk Tea and Taco Coconut with Tapioca (both good) at $2.50 a piece.
Our new favorite Asian restaurant in the Madison area. The restaurant is small but don't let that fool you. The food is GREAT!!! We have gone three times and each time we try different things. We have loved it each and every time. I'm picky, but at Asia Express I'm confident that the food I order is going to be great. From garlic chicken to beef and broccoli. I can't say enough good things about this place. Now go and try it for yourself.
Got the shrimp fried rice too.   Big flavorful shrimp makes this a winner.
Their delivery driver is very courteous as well.
Yummy, quick lunch! This is our go-to local Chinese restaurant. It has been consistently good over the past 4-5 years we have been living here. We especially like their luncheon specials and to go dinners. We love their mu shu chicken/pork and their wonton soup.
First time ordering. Delivery in 27 MINUTES (IMPRESSIVE) and I am thinking 'oh no food is going to be bad.' But no, it's good, not great, portions are huge! food was effin HOT
Food was very authentic, service was great.  The ambience was also fantastic. Will be going back for sure.
The manifestation of Yin and Yang is clearly present...like 'in your face' present when you're here. You'll see it from the moment you're seated, but you need to be observant...in tune...at one with the universe.
Overall the food was ok but it's not something I would order again.
Dig the chicken fried rice here.  My fav fast good Chinese here in the NW LV area.  I think I'm hooked on it.
3/5!
The one dish I did not like this time was the sweet and sour pork.  Chunks of pork battered and deep fried, served with chunks of peppers and onions.  The sweet red sauce is served on the side.  The only thing I didn't like was that the batter was so thick that they had to fry the pork longer than usual which made it super hard.  Hope your teeth are strong, because you're going to need it!  LOL!
On this particular night we were jonesing for some "good" Chinese dinner. This was the closest Chinese restaurant to our particular location, I should have kept looking. Take out dinner for four cost $60... $60! We got a subpar cashew chicken, two soggy orange chickens and overcooked shrimp in lobster sauce. Not only was the food not good and overpriced but they also forgot our rice. I have had very good Chinese food for a lot less money, I guess I'll just have too keep searching. I know some have had a good experience at this Chinese food restaurant and I am happy for them, I can only speak for my own personal experience. I don't know if I'll completely write this place off just yet since I haven't tried my old fall back, Kung pow shrimp. But I'll tell you this, give me a bad Kung pow shrimp and you are dead to me!
Wow, who would've though a place like this would have hand pulled noodles? Decidedly sketchy creepy plaza, but don't judge a book by its cover. Food is delicious and the price is right.
Prices are similar to PF Changs, but the ambiance is a little more upscale and hip. Nicely done!
Service:
Amlee Chinese Cuisine is a local family run business. They have been in business for over 30 years. I remember eating here when I was a teenager and really enjoying the food and lunch specials at Amlee Chinese Cuisine. After going to the movies at nearby Galaxy last week we passed by here so, I suggested to hubby that we come back and try this place and see if it was still as good as I remembered. With a fellow yelper in tow we headed for dinner here last night and wasn't disappointed. 4.5 stars!
We start with the seafood soup which contains shrimp, crab, scallops and is absolutely delicious.  Then the potstickers which sometimes are better than others but always good enough to keep getting them every time!  Then, the shrimp chow mein with garlic and the beef and broccoli.
I think hubby liked his fried rice but couldn't really tell as he was basically comatose :).
This place is popular w/ the overseas Chinese (and especially) of the college student variety... probably cuz the pricing is dirt cheap and gives them a bit of home.
Love this place. Small Mom and Pop place that Iv been coming to for 15+ years. Sesame chicken, Combination Low Mein, Kung Pao Beef and their crab puffs are my usual Go To's that have never let me down.
-They have a full bar so you can drink right before the cirque du soleil show (which we did)
And now it IS pretty bad. It starts at the host stand. I hate to call them out, but if there is a wait, they seat Asian people before Whitey!!! I actually sat and observed this on more than one occasion. I'm all for giving a little preferential treatment to your friends and family but there is no way the guy at the front knows every single Asian in town. 
The Jasmine Tea was delightful, and hot.
(2) Ice Water with lemon
Service was good...ambiance was okay.  We had the loudest group in Las Vegas at the next table.  They were shouting and laughing so loud, we couldn't hear our conversation.
The service was pretty decent and seems like most of the staff there (cook/servers) spoke Cantonese, so at least it makes the restaurant feel more authentic. The service was very fast too, had a nice Hong Kong feel to it.
bitch about everything that goes on in our
Mushroom appetizer: there's a mushroom appetizer they make that is really good. Comes out infused with some candy glaze that just takes over the flavor. It's great.
Been here twice now...super yummy!
As a side note, I once decided to pick-up my order rather than have it delivered, and based on what I saw, I'd probably not eat on-site.  The actual restaruant is singularly unappealing from the inside.  That doesn't factor into my rating in this review, however, as their delivery has never been anything other than prompt and their prices reasonable.
I'd say 3-star is O.K. and I'll stop in again eventually if I'm in the neighborhood.
Service was not that good.  I have heard that strong customer service is not a high priority at Chinese restaurants (more emphasis is placed on flavors and value).  Maybe this place was trying to emulate that even though it seemed to be an Americanized Chinese restaurant.  The waiter seemed confused and he left the table when we were ordering to check up on another table.  Other servers seemed a little bit abrupt.
My boyfriend and I are really sad that this place is closed. We tried it after driving by and seeing it, and would order it for take out half the time, or dine in the other half. It was clean, well priced, and good authentic Chinese (I can't stand Americanized Asian food). The lunch specials were inexpensive and we never had a problem there, but the place was always a ghost town every time we went. Bad location? Not really, it's very visible and on major streets with high traffic. I don't know what the problem was but I am sad to see it go. Time to try other Chinese places I've had bookmarked then. =(
hard to beat the lunch special....big portions, no extra charge for the rice, and a cup of soup.  on top of that, the people are always friendly and they deliver!
Red 8 is Wynn's informal Asian restaurant, open for lunch and dinner.  It serves a variety of Southeast Asian foods: Malaysian satays, Japanese noodles, Cantonese noodles and, on weekends, Hong Kong style dim sum.
When I walked in, I was greeted by a lady that said, "How can I help you?" I responded with, "Well, I'd like to place an order..." In looking at the lunch menu, it didn't seem like there were many options for vegetarians except tofu w/ mixed vegetables and tofu w/ broccoli. BORING! So I asked, "Is there a way to have Szechuan tofu instead of beef?" She replied, "No." I was like, "You can't substitute tofu for beef?" "No." Kind of annoyed, I said, "Ok, I'll have tofu w/ mixed vegetables." Then I noticed that the lunch special comes with pork fried rice so I asked if I could have veggie fried rice w/o the egg. She told me that it would be extra. Extra?!?!?! You're going to charge me to take OUT things? That's dumb. So I told her that I just wanted the tofu with vegetables....not the lunch special. She then said, "Well, we have tofu with eggplant in a garlic sauce....a lot of vegetarians order that. So I said that it would be fine. I was quoted a 10 min. timeframe. I asked if I could eat there and she said that it would be fine.
I want to be clear that I am picky about places with Asian influence as it is one of my absolute favourite kinds of foods. Long and Louie's takes the California fusion bistro concept way past the more famous rival PF Chang's! I want to say that I might be being stingy and unfair by not giving full marks but they probably deserve it. My two visits have both been satisfying.
I loved the salt and pepper spare ribs, salted fish fried rice, beef chow fun (they didn't overkill it with too much oil or bean sprouts), and honey walnut prawns.  I also noticed other patrons ordering stuff that you probably can only get if you speak Chinese.
Gisteravond na de overweldigende reviews op Yelp hier gegeten. Goed, maar geen 5*.
Always a place I MUST visit when I'm in town. My go-to's: cashew chicken, beef and broccoli, fried rice. The white boy Chinese selection :)
Great REAL Chinese food, great service and good drinks need I say more. Let's keep supporting a little local business.
The chicken mein fun was very good, too, but my boyfriend added soy sauce. Then again, he would put soy sauce on a shoe and eat it. Either way, he did taste it first and he did like it!
The Peking Pub offers nothing special.  The food was fine.  The atmosphere was slow.  Also, when I ordered my meal and the waitress asked if I wanted white or brown rice, I asked if I could have fried rice.  She said "yes"... but neglected to mention there would be a $12 charge!  Drinks were overpriced.  Meal was expensive.  I see no reason to return.
Pretty solid Chinese delivery, especially considering the side of town they're on! 
However, now on my recent health kick, I've really enjoyed that Baidu is nothing like that. Everything that it offers is super fresh, flavorful and surprisingly limited in grease factor.
Beef Pies - Excellent!!!  Very tasty and yummy.
My wife and I have been long-time customer.    :-)   I have actually been a customer since they have opened. I can say, with much confidence, they are always improving! The price is very much affordable. The delivery has always been on time. They treat U with respect. ...and that's all I have to say about that. Enjoy. 
They have lunch specials and also deliver between:
The hot tea was fresh and tasty. The servers are friendly, the food is quickly prepared. Even the takeout menu is really nice! Good glossy paper stock, nice graphic design, with flamingos watermarked into it. Well written, good layout. 
Although the food was passable, the service was brusque and impersonal, nearly rude. Maybe that is how they do it in China, but I expect a little more courtesy!
love their happy hour prices
Probably some of the worst Chinese food I've ever had.  Husband ordered the shrimp in lobster sauce & it was flavorless.  Shrimp was mushy as if they were overcooked.  I ordered chow mein & the noodles were overdone, sticky and the taste was bland as well.  Also ordered chicken fried rice & that was unflavored too.  Everything tasted bad.  We won't be back.  Very disappointed that ordering 3 dishes cost $30.
It was a ridiculous situation for a place of business and we were extremely annoyed.  The food was very good so I suggest getting it to go or move on to a professional establishment! It was hard to decide on a one or two star rating but I had to be honest.
At the end of our meal we were given the traditional fortune cookie as well as what I would describe as a bit of banana in a wonton with honey drizzled on it. That was a pleasant and delicious surprise.
